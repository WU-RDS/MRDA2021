This page will guide you through creating and editing R Markdown documents. This is a useful tool for reporting your analysis (e.g. for homework assignments). Of course, there is also [a cheat sheet for R-Markdown](https://www.rstudio.org/links/r_markdown_cheat_sheet) and [this book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) contains a comprehensive discussion of the format. 

The following video contains a short introduction to the R Markdown format.

### Creating a new R Markdown document {-}

In addition to the video, the following text contains a short description of the most important formatting options.  

Let's start to go through the steps of creating and .Rmd file and outputting the content to an HTML file. 

0. If an R-Markdown file was provided to you, open it with R-Studio and skip to [step 4](#step4) after adding your answers.

1. Open R-Studio

2. Create a new R-Markdown document

### Text and Equations {-}

R-Markdown documents are plain text files that include both text and R-code. Using RStudio they can be converted ('knitted') to HTML or PDF files that include both the text and the results of the R-code. In fact this website is written using R-Markdown and RStudio. In order for RStudio to be able to interpret the document you have to use certain characters or combinations of characters when formatting text and including R-code to be evaluated. By default the document starts with the options for the text part. You can change the title, date, author and a few more advanced options. 

![First lines of an R-Markdown document](./rmdExplain/rmdHead.PNG)

The default is text mode, meaning that lines in an Rmd document will be interpreted as text, unless specified otherwise.

#### Headings {-}

Usually you want to include some kind of heading to structure your text. A heading is created using `#` signs. A single `#` creates a first level heading, two `##` a second level and so on. 

![](./rmdExplain/headings.PNG)

It is important to note here that the ```#``` symbol means something different within the code chunks as opposed to outside of them. If you continue to put a ```#``` in front of all your regular text, it will all be interpreted as a first level heading, making your text very large.

#### Lists {-}

Bullet point lists are created using `*`, `+` or `-`. Sub-items are created by indenting the item using 4 spaces or 2 tabs. 

````
* First Item
* Second Item
    + first sub-item
        - first sub-sub-item
    + second sub-item
````
* First Item
* Second Item
    + first sub-item
        - first sub-sub-item
    + second sub-item


Ordered lists can be created using numbers and letters. If you need sub-sub-items use `A)` instead of `A.` on the third level. 

````
1. First item
    a. first sub-item
        A) first sub-sub-item 
     b. second sub-item
2. Second item
````

1. First item
    a. first sub-item
        A) first sub-sub-item
    b. second sub-item
2. Second item


#### Text formatting {-}

Text can be formatted in *italics* (`*italics*`) or **bold** (`**bold**`). In addition, you can ad block quotes with `>`

### R-Code {-}

R-code is contained in so called "chunks". These chunks always start with three backticks and ```r``` in curly braces (``` ```{r} ```) and end with three backticks (``` ``` ```). Optionally, parameters can be added after the ```r``` to influence how a chunk behaves. Additionally, you can also give each chunk a name. Note that these have to be **unique**, otherwise R will refuse to knit your document.

#### Global and chunk options {-}

The first chunk always looks as follows


    ```{r setup, include = FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
    ```

It is added to the document automatically and sets options for all the following chunks. These options can be overwritten on a per-chunk basis. 

Keep `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)` to print your code to the document you will hand in. Changing it to `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)` will not print your code by default. This can be changed on a per-chunk basis.




    ```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
    summary(cars)

    plot(dist~speed, cars)
    ```



```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/cars-1.png" width="672" />

 
    ```{r cars2, echo = TRUE}
    summary(cars)

    plot(dist~speed, cars)
    ```



```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

```r
plot(dist ~ speed, cars)
```

A good overview of all available global/chunk options can be found [here](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk_options).

### LaTeX Math {-}

Writing well formatted mathematical formulas is done the same way as in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). Math mode is started and ended using `$$`. 
````
$$
 f_1(\omega) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \pi},\ \omega \in[-\pi, \pi]
$$
````

$$
 f_1(\omega) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \pi},\ \omega \in[-\pi, \pi]
$$

(for those interested this is the spectral density of [white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise))

Including inline mathematical notation is done with a single ```$``` symbol. 

````
${2\over3}$ of my code is inline.

````
${2\over3}$ of my code is inline.

Take a look at [this wikibook on Mathematics in LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics#Symbols) and [this list of Greek letters and mathematical symbols](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/List_of_Greek_letters_and_math_symbols) if you are not familiar with LaTeX.

In order to write multi-line equations in the same math environment, use `\\` after every line. In order to insert a space use a single `\`. To render text inside a math environment use `\text{here is the text}`. In order to align equations start with `\begin{align}` and place an `&` in each line at the point around which it should be aligned. Finally end with `\end{align}`

````
$$
\begin{align}
\text{First equation: }\ Y &= X \beta + \epsilon_y,\ \forall X \\
\text{Second equation: }\ X &= Z \gamma + \epsilon_x
\end{align}
$$
````

$$
\begin{align}
\text{First equation: }\ Y &= X \beta + \epsilon_y,\ \forall X \\
\text{Second equation: }\ X &= Z \gamma + \epsilon_x
\end{align}
$$

#### Greek letters {-}

[Greek letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#Letters) are preceded by a `\` followed by their name (`$\beta$` = $\beta$). In order to capitalize them simply capitalize the first letter of the name (`$\Gamma$` = $\Gamma$).


## Solution assignment 2

As a marketing manager at an online fashion store, you would like to investigate ways to improve the performance metrics of the website (e.g., time on site, customer expenditure, conversion rate). The data file contains customer information from your web-shop. 

The following variables are included in the data set:

* **customerID:** unique customer ID
* **revenue:** revenue per customer for the past year (in EUR)
* **time_on_site:** average time a customer spends on your site per session using the default website design (in seconds)
* **time_on_site_1:** average time a customer spends on your site per session using the alternative website design (in seconds)
* **exp_group:** experimental group (2 levels: 0=control, 1=treatment) 
* **nps:** net promoter score received from customer after last checkout
* **retargeting:** type of online advertising that the customer was exposed to (3 levels: 1 = no advertising, 2 = generic retargeting, 3 = dynamic retargeting)
* **conversion:** indicator variable, indicating if a customer purchased something after clicking on a personalized add (0 = no conversion, 1 = conversion) 

Use R and appropriate methods to answer the following questions:

1. The accounting department asks you to provide an estimate of the average revenue per customer. Compute the 95% confidence interval for the mean revenue per customer and provide an interpretation of the interval.  
2. You run an A/B-Test on your website that aims at analyzing a new personalization feature to stimulate sales. To test the effect of this feature on revenues (variable: "revenue"), you randomly assign users either to a control group (status quo), or to a treatment group (the new personalization feature). The information regarding which group a customer has been assigned to is stored in the variable "exp_group". Is there a significant difference regarding the revenue between customers from the control and treatment groups? Please include the effect size Cohen's d and the confidence intervals in your report. 
3. After conducting the experiment described above, you would like to find out how to improve the user experience with regard to the new personalization feature. Thus, you expose the same customers from the treatment group from the previous experiment to an alternative page layout and record the time spend on the website after this change had been implemented (variable: "time_on_site_1"). Did the alternative page layout lead to a significant increase regarding the time your customers spend on your website? Please include the effect size Cohen's d and confidence intervals in your report.
4. Assume that you plan to run an experiment with two groups to test two different advertising strategies. You randomly assign website visitors to the control and experimental conditions and your goal is to test if there is a significant difference between the groups regarding the number of products they purchase from your store. How many users would you need to include in each group of your experiment if you assume the effect size to be 0.1 for a significance level of 0.05 and power of 0.8?  
5. You are interested in analyzing the effects of different types of online advertising (variable: "retargeting") on revenue per customer (variable: "revenue"). You conduct an experiment in which your customers were exposed to different types of online advertising (randomly assigned) and now you wish to analyze the results. Are there significant differences between the three groups? In your analysis, please inspect if there is an overall difference between the three groups first and then test for differences between the individual groups.  
6. After the last checkout, you conduct a short survey and obtain data on the Net Promoter Score. The question asks "How likely would you be to recommend [us] to a friend or colleague". The response is a value from 0 [very unlikely] to 10 [very likely]. Did the new personalization feature from the experiment in question 2 (variable: "exp_group") significantly influenced the ratings you obtain for the net promoter score (variable: "nps")?
7. The goal of the personalization feature was to trigger conversions (i.e., stimulate purchases). Thus, you recorded whether a click on the personalization feature lead to a purchase (variable: "conversion"). Please test the effect of the personalization feature on the conversion rate.   

When answering the questions, please remember to address the following points, where appropriate:

* Formulate the corresponding hypotheses and choose an appropriate statistical test
* Provide the reason for your choice and discuss if the assumptions of the test are met 
* Convert the variables to the appropriate type (e.g., factor variables)
* Create appropriate graphs to explore the data (e.g., plot of means incl. confidence intervals, histogram, boxplot)
* Provide appropriate descriptive statistics for the variables (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
* Report and interpret the test results accurately (including confidence intervals)  
* Finally, don't forget to report your research conclusion

When you are done with your analysis, click on "Knit to HTML" button above the code editor. This will create a HTML document of your results in the folder where the "assignment3.Rmd" file is stored. Open this file in your Internet browser to see if the output is correct. If the output is correct, submit the HTML file via Learn\@WU. The file name should be "assignment2_studendID_lastname.html".

**Load and inspect data**

Let´s load the data first and inspect the contained variables:


```r
customer_data <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WU-RDS/MRDA2021/main/Assignments/Assignment2/assignment2_data.dat",
    sep = "\t", header = TRUE)  #read in data

##  $ conversion    : int  0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 ...
```

**Load packages**

Next, we load the packages that we will be using to answer the questions:


```r
library(pastecs)
library(ggplot2)
library(psych)
library(pwr)
library(lsr)
library(reshape2)
library(ggstatsplot)
library(Rmisc)
library(plyr)
```



**Question 1**

To compute the confidence interval for the average revenue per customer, we will need three things: 1) the mean $\bar x$, 2) the standard error ($s \over \sqrt{n}$), and 3) the critical value for a t-distribution ($t_{crit}$; we will use a t-distribution, because we are not sure of the variance in the population; for this assignment, also the normal distribution and the corresponding $z$-score would have been counted as correct).



```r
# Calculate components of confidence interval
# formula
mean_rev <- mean(customer_data$revenue)  #mean
sd_rev <- sd(customer_data$revenue)  #standard deviation
n <- nrow(customer_data)  #number of observations 
se_rev <- sd_rev/sqrt(n)
df <- n - 1  #degress of freedom
t_crit <- qt(0.975, df)
```

Now the confidence interval can be computed according to the equation: 

$$CI_{rev} = \bar x \pm t_{ \alpha \over 2}*SE_{\bar x}$$


```r
# Interval for revenue
ci_lower <- mean_rev - t_crit * se_rev
ci_upper <- mean_rev + t_crit * se_rev
```

Hence, the CI for the revenue variable is given by:


```r
ci_lower
```

```
## [1] 1625.715
```

```r
ci_upper
```

```
## [1] 1823.375
```

$CI_{rev} = [1625.72,1823.38]$

The intervals can be interpreted as follows: If we would take 100 samples, calculate the mean and confidence interval for each of them, then the true population mean would be included in 95% of these intervals. In the sample at hand, this interval spans from 1625.72 to 1823.38.

**Question 2**

First we will analyze whether the personalization feature that was tested in the A/B-test had an effect on SD revenues. We need to formulate a hypothesis which we can test. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the feature had no effect on the mean revenue, i.e. that there is no difference in the mean revenue between the two populations. The alternative hypothesis states that the campaign _did_ have an effect, meaning that there is a difference in the mean revenue between the populations. In more formal notation this is:

$$H_0: \mu_0 = \mu_1 \\ H_1: \mu_0 \neq \mu_1$$

We need to transform the variable *exp_group* into a factor variable. Note that it is a good idea to do data transformations separate from the analysis in a separate code chunk. This avoids the code being executed twice, which would lead to difficulties because the factor variable would be overwritten with missing (NA) values.  


```r
# Transform into factor variable
customer_data$exp_group <- factor(customer_data$exp_group,
    levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("control", "treatment"))
```

A good way to get a feeling for the data is to compute descriptive statistics and create appropriate plots. Since we are testing differences in means, a plot of means (or a boxplot) would be appropriate. 

Let's inspect the descriptive statistics first:


```r
# Descriptive statistics
describeBy(customer_data$revenue, customer_data$exp_group)
```

```
## 
##  Descriptive statistics by group 
## group: control
##    vars   n    mean     sd median trimmed    mad min  max range skew kurtosis
## X1    1 141 1504.08 789.67   1405  1484.4 787.26  72 3940  3868 0.33    -0.16
##      se
## X1 66.5
## ------------------------------------------------------------ 
## group: treatment
##    vars   n    mean     sd median trimmed    mad min  max range skew kurtosis
## X1    1 145 1938.93 852.59   1876 1918.51 895.49 167 5077  4910 0.38     0.25
##      se
## X1 70.8
```
It can already be seen that the mean revenue is higher in the treatment group. 


```r
mean_data <- summarySE(customer_data, measurevar = "revenue",
    groupvars = c("exp_group"))

# Plot of means
ggplot(mean_data, aes(x = exp_group, y = revenue)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge(0.9), colour = "black",
        fill = "#CCCCCC", stat = "identity", width = 0.65) +
    geom_errorbar(position = position_dodge(0.9), width = 0.15,
        aes(ymin = revenue - ci, ymax = revenue + ci)) +
    theme_bw() + labs(x = "Group", y = "Average revenue",
    title = "Average revenue by group") + theme_bw() +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "#666666"))
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" />

As we can see in both the descriptive statistics and the plot, the mean revenues were higher for the group that was exposed to the new personalization feature. To test whether or not this difference is significant, we need to use a __independent-means t-test__. We use an independent-means t-test because we have different customers in each group, meaning that we have collected the data using a between-subjects design (i.e., the customers in one condition are *independent* of the customers in the other condition). The requirements are clearly met:

* Our dependent variable (revenue) is measured on an interval scale
* Since we have more than 30 observations per group we do not really have to concern ourselves with whether the data is normally distributed or not (see central limit theorem)
* If a customer was exposed to the feature or not was assigned randomly (i.e., the groups are independent)
* R automatically performs Welch's t-test, which corrects for unequal variance 

Thus we can perform the test in R


```r
t.test(revenue ~ exp_group, data = customer_data)
```

```
## 
## 	Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  revenue by exp_group
## t = -4.4767, df = 283.33, p-value = 0.000011
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -626.0553 -243.6507
## sample estimates:
##   mean in group control mean in group treatment 
##                1504.078                1938.931
```

The test is significant, since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, leading us to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean revenue. The p-value states the probability of finding a difference of the observed magnitude or higher, if the null hypothesis was in fact true (i.e., if there was in fact no difference between the populations). In effect, this means that the personalization feature had an effect on the average expenditure. Another thing we can extract from this test result is the confidence interval around the difference in means. Since 0 is not included in the interval, it is not a plausible value, confirming the conclusion to reject the null hypothesis.

The standardized effect size can be computed using the ```cohensD``` function:


```r
cohensD(revenue ~ exp_group, data = customer_data)
```

```
## [1] 0.5289074
```

This magnitude of the effect size (0.52) suggests that the effect of the personalization feature on the expenditures is medium to large.

Alternatively, you could also use the `ggstatsplot` package to conduct the tests: 


```r
ggbetweenstats(
  data = customer_data,
  plot.type = "box",
  x = exp_group, # 2 groups
  y = revenue ,
  type = "p", # default
  effsize.type = "d", # display effect size (Cohen's d in output)
  messages = FALSE,
  bf.message = FALSE,
  mean.ci = TRUE,
  title = "Average revenue per customer by group"
)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" />

Finally, we can conclude from this study that the personalization feature causes users to increase their expenditures and this feature should hence be implemented on the website. 

**Question 3**

Next we want to examine whether the alternative page layout has an effect on the time that a user spends on the website. The null hypothesis here is that there is no difference in the mean time spend on the website for the same customers between the two alternative page layouts. Because the observations come from the same population of customers (i.e., a within-subject design), we refer to the difference in the means for the same population as $\mu_D$ when stating our hypotheses. The alternative hypothesis states that that there is a difference between the time on site variables for the same customers. In mathematical notation this can be written as

$$H_0: \mu_D = 0 \\ H_1: \mu_D \neq 0$$


Again, we start with descriptive statistics to get a feel for the data. Note that in order to compare the groups, it is important to base the comparison on the same sample. Since only customers from the treatment condition in the first experiment have been included in this follow-up study, we need to make sure that the customers who were not included in the study are not considered when comparing the means: 


```r
# Descriptive statistics
psych::describe(customer_data[!is.na(customer_data$time_on_site_1),
    c("time_on_site", "time_on_site_1")])
```

```
##                vars   n   mean     sd median trimmed    mad min  max range
## time_on_site      1 145 783.12 324.73    769  785.13 346.93  43 1530  1487
## time_on_site_1    2 145 813.97 324.81    794  816.09 345.45  78 1552  1474
##                 skew kurtosis    se
## time_on_site   -0.02    -0.41 26.97
## time_on_site_1 -0.03    -0.43 26.97
```

As can be seen, the mean for the alternative page layout is higher, which we can also show visually using a plot of means (or alternatively a boxplot). 


```r
# Plot of means
customer_data_long <- melt(customer_data[!is.na(customer_data$time_on_site_1),
    c("time_on_site", "time_on_site_1")])
names(customer_data_long) <- c("layout", "time_on_site")

mean_data <- summarySE(customer_data_long, measurevar = "time_on_site",
    groupvars = c("layout"))

# Plot of means
ggplot(mean_data, aes(x = layout, y = time_on_site)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge(0.9), colour = "black",
        fill = "#CCCCCC", stat = "identity", width = 0.65) +
    geom_errorbar(position = position_dodge(0.9), width = 0.15,
        aes(ymin = time_on_site - ci, ymax = time_on_site +
            ci)) + theme_bw() + labs(x = "layout",
    y = "Average time on site", title = "Average time on site by group") +
    theme_bw() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,
    color = "#666666"))
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" />



It appears that there is a difference in the means. To test whether it is significant, we again need a t-test. However, this time we need a slightly different version of the t-test because the same customers are observed for the two page layouts (i.e., the same customers are shown both layouts). This means that we need a __dependent means t-test__. This test is also known as the **paired samples t-test**. The other assumptions are virtually identical to the independent-means t-test. The test can be executed in R by adding ```paired = TRUE``` to the code.   


```r
t.test(y = customer_data$time_on_site, x = customer_data$time_on_site_1,
    paired = TRUE)
```

```
## 
## 	Paired t-test
## 
## data:  customer_data$time_on_site_1 and customer_data$time_on_site
## t = 39.242, df = 144, p-value < 0.00000000000000022
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  29.28793 32.39483
## sample estimates:
## mean of the differences 
##                30.84138
```
The p-value is again lower than the chosen significance level of 5% (i.e., p < .05), which means that we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean time on site between the two page layouts. Make sure you interpret the p-value correctly. It refers to the probability of observing a difference of the observed magnitude (or larger) between the two layouts, assuming that there was in fact no difference between the layouts The confidence interval confirms the conclusion to reject the null hypothesis since $0$ is not contained in the range of plausible values.

Now let's find out how strong this effect is.


```r
cohensD(customer_data$time_on_site, customer_data$time_on_site_1,
    method = "paired")
```

```
## [1] 3.258853
```
A standardized effect size of approx. 3.23 tells us that this effect is (very) large.

Alternatively, you could also use the `ggstatsplot` package to conduct the tests and extract the relevant information from there: 


```r
ggwithinstats(
  data = customer_data_long,
  x = layout,
  y = time_on_site,
  path.point = FALSE,
  path.mean = TRUE,
  sort = "descending", # ordering groups along the x-axis based on
  sort.fun = mean, # values of `y` variable
  title = "Time on site for different page layouts",
  messages = FALSE,
  bf.message = FALSE,
  mean.ci = TRUE,
  effsize.type = "d" # display effect size (Cohen's d in output)
)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="672" />

The conclusion from this test would be that the alternative page layout increases the time that users spend on the website and, thus, the alternative layout should be implemented as the new standard. 

**Question 4**

The question of how many customers we would need to include in each group of our experiment can be answered quite comfortably with a power calculation function in R.


```r
pwr.t.test(d = 0.1, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8,
    type = c("two.sample"), alternative = c("two.sided"))
```

```
## 
##      Two-sample t test power calculation 
## 
##               n = 1570.733
##               d = 0.1
##       sig.level = 0.05
##           power = 0.8
##     alternative = two.sided
## 
## NOTE: n is number in *each* group
```

To achieve our desired effect size of 0.1, a significance level of 0.5 and a power of 0.8 we would need to include at least 1,571 customers per group in the planned experiment.

**Question 5**

To answer the question of whether the type of advertising has an effect on revenue, we need to formulate a testable null hypothesis. In our case, the null hypothesis is stating that the average level of sales is equal for all three advertising types. In mathematical notation this implies:

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 $$

The alternate hypothesis is simply that the means are not all equal, i.e., 

$$H_1: \textrm{Means are not all equal}$$

If you wanted to put this in mathematical notation, you could also write:

$$H_1: \exists {i,j}: {\mu_i \ne \mu_j} $$

The appropriate test for such a hypothesis is one-way ANOVA since we have a metric scales dependent variable and a categorical independent variable with more than two levels.


First, we will recode the relevant variables into factors and give them more descriptive level names: 


```r
customer_data$retargeting <- factor(customer_data$retargeting,
    levels = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c("no retargeting",
        "generic retargeting", "dynamic retargeting"))
```

Next we will calculate summary statistics for the data and produce an appropriate plot.


```r
describeBy(customer_data$revenue, customer_data$retargeting)
```

```

```r
mean_data <- summarySE(customer_data, measurevar = "revenue",
    groupvars = c("retargeting"))
ggplot(mean_data, aes(x = retargeting, y = revenue)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge(1), colour = "black",
        fill = "#CCCCCC", stat = "identity", width = 0.65) +
    geom_errorbar(position = position_dodge(0.9), width = 0.15,
        aes(ymin = revenue - ci, ymax = revenue + ci)) +
    theme_bw() + labs(x = "Group", y = "Average revenue",
    title = "Average revenue by group") + theme_bw() +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "#666666"))
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Both the summary statistics and the plot hint at the fact that the means may not be equal. Especially the difference between dynamic retargeting and no retargeting/ generic regtargeting seem to be quite high. Before we move to the formal test, we need to see if a series of assumptions are met, namely:

* Distributional assumptions
* Homogeneity of variances
* Independence of observations

The last assumption is satisfied due to the fact that the observations were randomly assigned to the advertisement groups. To see if we need to worry about distributional assumptions we first take a look at the number of observations in each advertising group.


```r
# check number of observations by group
table(customer_data$retargeting)
```

```
## 
##      no retargeting generic retargeting dynamic retargeting 
##                 103                  87                  96
```

Due to the fact that there are always more than 30 observations in each group we can rely on the central limit theorem to satisfy the distributional assumptions. 

Homogeneity of variances can be checked with Levene's test (implemented as ```leveneTest()``` from the ```car``` package). The null hypothesis of this test is that the variances are equal, with the alternative hypothesis being that the variances are not all equal. Note that this step could also be skipped and replaced by the use of the robust ANOVA using the `oneway.test()` function. 


```r
# Homogeneity of variances test:
library(car)
leveneTest(revenue ~ retargeting, data = customer_data,
    center = mean)
```

```
## Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = mean)
##        Df F value Pr(>F)
## group   2  1.4005 0.2482
##       283
```

The test result is insignificant (for a significance level of 5 %), meaning that we do not reject the null hypothesis of equal variances and can operate under the assumption that the variances are equal. 

Since all assumptions are fulfilled we can move on to conducting the actual ANOVA using the ```aov()``` function. As said above, it would also be possible to conduct the analysis using the robust ANOVA using the `oneway.test()` function, which has an in-build correction for unequal variances across groups:


```r
# Anova:
aov <- aov(revenue ~ retargeting, data = customer_data)
summary(aov)
```

```
##              Df    Sum Sq  Mean Sq F value        Pr(>F)    
## retargeting   2  27948872 13974436   22.27 0.00000000104 ***
## Residuals   283 177543625   627363                          
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

The p-value is smaller than 0.05, which we chose as our significance level, meaning that we reject the null hypothesis of the means being equal in the three advertising groups. 

Next we will briefly inspect the residuals of the ANOVA to see if the assumptions of the test really are justified.


```r
# Inspect residuals
plot(aov, 1)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="672" />

The first plot gives us a feel for the distribution of the residuals of the three groups. The residuals seem to be roughly equally distributed, which speaks for the fact that the homogeneity of variances assumptions is fulfilled. 


```r
plot(aov, 2)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" width="672" />

The second plot is a QQ-plot of the residuals, meant as a quick visual check to see if the normality assumption is fulfilled. Leading up to the test we only checked if there were more than 30 observations per group to satisfy the normality assumption but despite this being fulfilled it is still important to check the normality of the residuals, as any strange behavior here may indicate problems with the model specification. 

To further confirm that the residuals are roughly normally distributed we employ the Shapiro-Wilk test. The null hypothesis is that the distribution of the data is normal, with the alternative hypothesis positing that the data is not normally distributed.


```r
shapiro.test(resid(aov))
```

```
## 
## 	Shapiro-Wilk normality test
## 
## data:  resid(aov)
## W = 0.99294, p-value = 0.1961
```

The p value is far above any widely used significance level and thus we can not reject the null hypothesis of normal distribution, which further implies that the normality assumption is fulfilled.

The ANOVA result only tells us that the means of the three groups are not equal, but it does not tell us anything about _which_ pairs of means are unequal. To find this out we need to conduct post hoc tests to test the following null hypotheses for the respective pairwise comparisons.

$$1) H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2; H_1 = \mu_1 \neq \mu_2 \\
2) H_0: \mu_2 = \mu_3; H_1 = \mu_2 \neq \mu_3 \\
3) H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_3; H_1 = \mu_1 \neq \mu_3 $$

Here we will conduct both the Bonferroni correction as well as Tukey's HSD test, however either would be sufficient for your homework. Bonferroni's correction conducts multiple pairwise t-tests, with the null hypothesis being that of equal means in each case and the alternative hypothesis stating that the means are unequal.


```r
# bonferroni
pairwise.t.test(customer_data$revenue, customer_data$retargeting,
    data = customer_data, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
```

```
## 
## 	Pairwise comparisons using t tests with pooled SD 
## 
## data:  customer_data$revenue and customer_data$retargeting 
## 
##                     no retargeting generic retargeting
## generic retargeting 0.26           -                  
## dynamic retargeting 0.0000000011   0.0000252619       
## 
## P value adjustment method: bonferroni
```

The Bonferroni test reinforces what we saw in our plot earlier, namely that not all of the means might be significantly different from each other.

We can only reject the null hypothesis in the cases:  
dynamic regargeting vs. no retargeting  
dynamic regargeting vs. generig retargeting  

But there seems to be no difference in the means of generic retargeting vs. no retargeting.

Alternatively, you could have also chosen to use Tukey's HSD to conduct the post hoc test. Tukey's HSD similarly compares pairwise means, corrected for family-wise errors (both of the post hoc tests would have been considered correct).   


```r
# tukey correction using the mult-comp package
library(multcomp)
tukeys <- glht(aov, linfct = mcp(retargeting = "Tukey"))
summary(tukeys)
```

```

```

Tukey's correction confirms the conclusion from the Bonferroni test from above. While there seems to be no difference in the means of generic retargeting vs. no retargeting, dynamic retargeting seems to differ significantly from both generic retargeting and no retargeting. 

Tukey's HSD further let's us estimate the difference in means with corresponding confidence intervals.


```r
confint(tukeys)
```

```
##

```

```r
# The mar parameter changes the margins around
# created plots. This is done so the labels on

plot(tukeys)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" width="672" />

It is clearly visible that just the CIs of generic retargetring vs. no retargeting cross the 0 bound, which further indicates that the differences in means are statistically not significantly different from 0.

From a reporting standpoint we can say that revenue is higher when using dynamic retargeting vs. no retargeting or generic retargeting, but there is no significant difference between the sales for products in the  dynamic retargeting vs. no retargeting conditions. Managerially, this means that only dynamic retargetting helps us to increase sales and should thus be the preferred choice. 

**Question 6**

For this question we want to examine whether the scores from the NPS measurement are significantly different for the experimental groups. Because we are dealing with data on an ordinal scale, we can not use a t-test for this analysis. The non-parametric counterpart is the Mann-Whitney U Test, which tests for differences in medians between groups. Hence, the null hypothesis is that the medians are equal in each group and the alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in medians. 

$$H_0: \bar{\mu}_1 =  \bar{\mu}_2  \\ H_1: \bar{\mu}_0 \neq \bar{\mu}_1 $$
Let's inspect the descriptive statistics first:


```r
# Descriptive statistics for NPS, split by group
describeBy(customer_data$nps, customer_data$exp_group)
```

```
## 
##  Descriptive statistics by group 
## group: control
##    vars   n mean   sd median trimmed  mad min max range  skew kurtosis   se
## X1    1 141 8.11 2.18      9    8.47 1.48   1  10     9 -1.36     1.45 0.18
## ------------------------------------------------------------ 
## group: treatment
##    vars   n mean   sd median trimmed  mad min max range  skew kurtosis   se
## X1    1 145 6.83 3.01      8    7.17 2.97   0  10    10 -0.81    -0.55 0.25
```

A good way to visualize ordinal data is through a boxplot.


```r
ggplot(data = customer_data, aes(x = exp_group, y = nps)) +
    geom_boxplot() + theme_bw() + labs(x = "", y = "Rank")
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The boxplot seems to indicate that the medians are unequal. Surprisingly, the plot indicates that the median NPS score is lower in the treatment group. The may be due to, for example, that while the customers spend more money due to the personalization feature, this feature actually reduces the NPS, possibly because customers are not comfortable with the use of their personal data for advertising purposes.  

The only assumption that we require for this test is that the dependent variable is at least ordinal, which is fulfilled for customer ranks. Hence we can move on to performing the test in R.


```r
# ordinal data so we use a non-parametric test
wilcox.test(nps ~ exp_group, data = customer_data)
```

```
## 
## 	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction
## 
## data:  nps by exp_group
## W = 12749, p-value = 0.0002381
## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
```
The p-value is below 0.05 and thus we reject the null hypothesis of equal medians. This means that the NPS scores of customers is different for the group that received the personalization feature, implying that the type of personalization feature has an effect on the NPS scores.

Alternatively, you could also use the `ggstatsplot` package to conduct the test: 


```r
ggbetweenstats(
  data = customer_data,
  plot.type = "box",
  x = exp_group, # 2 groups
  y = nps ,
  type = "np", # default
  effsize.type = "d", # display effect size (Cohen's d in output)
  messages = FALSE,
  bf.message = FALSE,
  mean.ci = TRUE,
  title = "NPS score by group"
)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="672" />

Considering this test in isolation would indicate that the new personalization feature significantly decreases the NPS scores of your company and should, thus, not be implemented. This would be sufficient as a managerial implication from this test for the assignment. However, taken together, this result and the result from Question 2 that the personalization feature increases revenues indicates that further analyses are reuqired to reach a final conclusion regarding this questions. 

**Question 7**

To find out if the new personalization feature has an effect on the conversion rate, we can use a test for proportions instead of a test for mean differences. To test for the equality of proportions (and therefore no difference between them) we can use a $\chi^2$ test.

Our null hypothesis in this case states that the proportions of conversion are the groups with and without the personalization feature. Our alternative hypothesis states that these proportions are unequal.

$$H_0: \pi_1 = \pi_2 \\ H_1: \pi_1 \neq \pi_2$$
First, we will recode the relevant variables into factors and give them more descriptive level names. Note that the *exp_group* variable had already been converted to a factor variable and, thus, does not need to be converted to a factor variable again.  


```r
customer_data$conversion <- factor(customer_data$conversion,
    levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("no", "yes"))
```

First let´s create a summary plot to get a feeling for the data.


```r
#conditional relative frequencies
rel_freq_table <- as.data.frame(prop.table(table(customer_data$exp_group, customer_data$conversion), 1))
names(rel_freq_table) <- c("group", "conversion","freq") # changing names of the columns
rel_freq_table
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["group"],"name":[1],"type":["fct"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["conversion"],"name":[2],"type":["fct"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["freq"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"control","2":"no","3":"0.8723404"},{"1":"treatment","2":"no","3":"0.6344828"},{"1":"control","2":"yes","3":"0.1276596"},{"1":"treatment","2":"yes","3":"0.3655172"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

```r
ggplot(rel_freq_table, aes(x = group, y = freq, fill = conversion)) + #plot data
  geom_col(width = .7) + #position
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(freq*100,0),"%")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 4) + #add percentages
  ylab("Proportion of conversions") + xlab("group") + # specify axis labels
  theme_bw()
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/question_3_1-1.png" width="672" />

We see that our conversion seems to be better for the group with the personalization feature, but let´s check whether these proportions are significantly different.


```r
n1 <- nrow(subset(customer_data, exp_group == "control"))  #number of observations for females
n2 <- nrow(subset(customer_data, exp_group == "treatment"))  #number of observations for males
n1_conv <- nrow(subset(customer_data, exp_group ==
    "control" & conversion == "yes"))  #number of conversions for females
n2_conv <- nrow(subset(customer_data, exp_group ==
    "treatment" & conversion == "yes"))  #number of conversions for males

prop.test(x = c(n1_conv, n2_conv), n = c(n1, n2), conf.level = 0.95)
```

```
## 
## 	2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction
## 
## data:  c(n1_conv, n2_conv) out of c(n1, n2)
## X-squared = 20.416, df = 1, p-value = 0.000006231
## alternative hypothesis: two.sided
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -0.3406543 -0.1350610
## sample estimates:
##    prop 1    prop 2 
## 0.1276596 0.3655172
```
The test showed that the conversion rate for the personalization feature was 23% higher compared to the control group. This difference is highly significant $\chi^2$ (1) = 20.4, p < .05 (95% CI = [0.13,0.37]), which means that we can reject our null hypothesis of equal probability and state that there indeed is a difference between the groups. In managerial terms this means that the personalization feature increases the conversion rate by making the ads more relevant for the customers and the feature should thus be implemented (but see the discussion about lower NPS scores).

This information could have also been extracted using the ggstatsplot package:


```r
library(ggstatsplot)
ggbarstats(data = customer_data, x = conversion, y = exp_group,
    title = "Conversion by group", xlab = "Group",
    palette = "Blues", messages = FALSE, bar.proptest = FALSE,
    bf.message = FALSE)
```

## Solution assignment 3

As a marketing manager of a consumer electronics company, you are assigned the task to analyze the relative influence of different marketing activities. Specifically, you are supposed to analyze the effects of (1) TV advertising, (2) online advertising, and (3) radio advertising on the sales of fitness trackers (wristbands). Your data set consists of sales of the product in different markets (each line represents one market) from the past year, along with the advertising budgets for the product in each of those markets for three different media: TV, online, and radio. 

The following variables are available to you:
  
* Sales (in thousands of units)
* TV advertising budget (in thousands of Euros)
* Online advertising budget (in thousands of Euros)
* Radio advertising budget (in thousands of Euros)

Please conduct the following analyses: 
  
1. Formally state the regression equation, which you will use to determine the relative influence of the marketing activities on sales.
2. Describe the model variables using appropriate statistics and plots
3. Estimate a multiple linear regression model to determine the relative influence of each of the variables. Before you interpret the results, test if the model assumptions are fulfilled and use appropriate tests and plots to test the assumptions.
4. Interpret the model results:
* Which variables have a significant influence on sales and what is the interpretation of the coefficients?
* What is the relative importance of the predictor variables?
* Interpret the F-test
* How do you judge the fit of the model? Please also visualize the model fit using an appropriate graph.
5. What sales quantity would you predict based on your model for a product when the marketing activities are planned as follows: TV: 150 thsd. €, Online: 26 thsd. €, Radio: 15 thsd. €? Please provide the equation you used to make the prediction. 

When you are done with your analysis, click on "Knit to HTML" button above the code editor. This will create a HTML document of your results in the folder where the "assignment3.Rmd" file is stored. Open this file in your Internet browser to see if the output is correct. If the output is correct, submit the HTML file via Learn\@WU. The file name should be "assignment3_studendID_name.html".

```r

```
## 'data.frame':	236 obs. of  5 variables:
##  $ tv_adspend    : num  68.6 136.6 14.5 214.6 285 ...
##  $ online_adspend: num  10.3 29 44.3 26.2 13.9 74.9 31.1 14.1 24.5 13.9 ...

##  $ market_id     : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
```

**Question 1**

In a first step, we specify the regression equation. In this case, sales is the dependent variable which is regressed on the different types of advertising expenditures that represent the independent variables for product *i*. Thus, the regression equation is:

$$Sales_{i}=\beta_0 + \beta_1 * tv\_adspend_{i} + \beta_2 * online\_adspend_{i} + \beta_3 * radio\_adspend_{i} + \epsilon$$
  
**Question 2**
  
The descriptive statistics can be checked using the ```describe()``` function:
  

```r
library(psych)
psych::describe(sales_data)
```

```
##                vars   n   mean    sd median trimmed    mad min   max range skew

## online_adspend    2 236  25.61 14.33  24.35   24.70  14.53 1.6  74.9  73.3 0.61

## sales             4 236  14.83  5.40  14.15   14.72   5.93 1.4  29.0  27.6 0.16

## sales             -0.57 0.35
## market_id         -1.22 4.44
```

Inspecting the correlation matrix reveals that the sales variable is positively correlated with tv advertising and online advertising expenditures. The correlations among the independent variables appear moderate. 
  

```r
library("Hmisc")
rcorr(as.matrix(sales_data[, c("sales", "tv_adspend",
    "online_adspend", "radio_adspend")]))
```

```
##                sales tv_adspend online_adspend radio_adspend

## tv_adspend      0.78       1.00           0.05          0.03

## n= 236 
## 
## 
## P
##                sales  tv_adspend online_adspend radio_adspend
## sales                 0.0000     0.0000         0.5316       
## tv_adspend     0.0000            0.4127         0.6735       
## online_adspend 0.0000 0.4127                    0.2790       
## radio_adspend  0.5316 0.6735     0.2790
```

Since we have continuous variables, we use scatterplots to investigate the relationship between sales and each of the predictor variables.


```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(sales_data, aes(x = tv_adspend, y = sales)) +
    geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", fill = "blue",
    alpha = 0.1) + theme_bw()
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-43-1.png" width="672" />

```r
ggplot(sales_data, aes(x = online_adspend, y = sales)) +
    geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", fill = "blue",
    alpha = 0.1) + theme_bw()
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-43-2.png" width="672" />

```r
ggplot(sales_data, aes(x = radio_adspend, y = sales)) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.1) +
    geom_point() + theme_bw()
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-43-3.png" width="672" />

The plots including the fitted lines from a simple linear model already suggest that there might be a positive linear relationship between sales and TV- and online-advertising. However, there does not appear to be a strong relationship between sales and radio advertising. 

**Question 3**
  
The estimate the model, we will use the ```lm()``` function:
  

```r
linear_model <- lm(sales ~ tv_adspend + online_adspend +
    radio_adspend, data = sales_data)
```

Before we can inspect the results, we need to test if there might be potential problems with our model specification. 

*Outliers*

The check for outliers, we extract the studentized residuals from our model and test if there are any absolute values larger than 3. 
  

```r
sales_data$stud_resid <- rstudent(linear_model)
plot(1:nrow(sales_data), sales_data$stud_resid, ylim = c(-3.3,
    3.3))  #create scatterplot 
abline(h = c(-3, 3), col = "red", lty = 2)  #add reference lines
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png" width="672" />

Since there are no residuals with absolute values larger than 3, we conclude that there are no severe outliers. 

*Influencial observations*

To test for influential observations, we use Cook's Distance. You may use the following two plots to verify if any Cook's Distance values are larger than the cutoff of 1. 


```r
plot(linear_model, 4)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png" width="672" />

```r
plot(linear_model, 5)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-2.png" width="672" />

Since all values are well below the cutoff, we conclude that influential observations are not a problem in our model. 

*Non-linear relationships*

Next, we test if a linear specification appears feasible. You could test this using the added variable plots:


```r
library(car)
avPlots(linear_model)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-47-1.png" width="672" />

The plots suggest that the linear specification is appropriate. In addition, you could also use the residuals plot to see if the linear specification is appropriate. The red line is a smoothed curve through the residuals plot and if it deviates from the dashed grey horizontal line a lot, this would suggest that a linear specification is not appropriate. 


```r
plot(linear_model, 1)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png" width="672" />

In this example, the red line is close to the dashed grey line, so the linear specification appears reasonable. 

*Heteroscedasticity*

Next, we test if the residual variance is approximately the same at all levels of the predicted outcome variables (i.e., homoscedasticity). To do this, we use the residuals plot again.


```r
plot(linear_model, 1)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-49-1.png" width="672" />

The spread of residuals at different levels of the predicted outcome does not appear to be very different. Thus, we can conclude that heteroscedasticity is unlikely to be a problem. We can also confirm this conclusion by using the Breusch-Pagan test, which shows an insignificant results, meaning that we cannot reject the Null Hypothesis of equal variances. 


```r
library(lmtest)
bptest(linear_model)
```

```
## 
## 	studentized Breusch-Pagan test
## 
## data:  linear_model
## BP = 1.7583, df = 3, p-value = 0.6241
```

*Non-normally distributed errors*

Next, we test if the residuals are approximately normally distributed using the Q-Q plot from the output:


```r
plot(linear_model, 2)
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png" width="672" />

The Q-Q plot does not suggest a severe deviation from a normal distribution. This could also be validated using the Shapiro test:


```r
shapiro.test(resid(linear_model))
```

```
## 
## 	Shapiro-Wilk normality test
## 
## data:  resid(linear_model)
## W = 0.99412, p-value = 0.4875
```

*Correlation of errors*

We actually wouldn't need to test this assumption here since there is not natural order in the data. 

*Multicollinearity*

To test for linear dependence of the regressors, we first test the bivariate correlations for any extremely high correlations (i.e., >0.8).


```r
library("Hmisc")
rcorr(as.matrix(sales_data[, c("tv_adspend", "online_adspend",
    "radio_adspend")]))
```

```
##                tv_adspend online_adspend radio_adspend
## tv_adspend           1.00           0.05          0.03
## online_adspend       0.05           1.00         -0.07
## radio_adspend        0.03          -0.07          1.00
## 
## n= 236 
## 
## 
## P
##                tv_adspend online_adspend radio_adspend
## tv_adspend                0.4127         0.6735       
## online_adspend 0.4127                    0.2790       
## radio_adspend  0.6735     0.2790
```

The results show that the bivariate correlations are low to moderate. This can also be shown in a plot:


```r
plot(sales_data[, c("tv_adspend", "online_adspend",
    "radio_adspend")])
```

<img src="14-rmdIntro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-54-1.png" width="672" />

In a next step, we compute the variance inflation factor for each predictor variable. The values should be close to 1 and values larger than 4 indicate potential problems with the linear dependence of regressors.  


```r
library(car)
vif(linear_model)
```

```
##     tv_adspend online_adspend  radio_adspend 
##       1.003873       1.008157       1.006028
```

Here, all vif values are well below the cutoff, indicating that there are no problems with multicollinearity. 

**Question 4**

In a next step, we will investigate the results from the model using the ```summary()``` function. 
  

```r
summary(linear_model)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = sales ~ tv_adspend + online_adspend + radio_adspend, 
##     data = sales_data)

## radio_adspend  -0.011469   0.010656  -1.076                0.283    
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 2.048 on 232 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.8582,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8564 
## F-statistic: 468.1 on 3 and 232 DF,  p-value: < 0.00000000000000022
```

For each of the individual predictors, we test the following hypothesis: 

$$H_0: \beta_k=0$$
$$H_1: \beta_k\ne0$$

where k denotes the number of the regression coefficient. In the present example, we reject the null hypothesis for the first two predictors, where we observe a significant effect (i.e., p < 0.05 for "tv_adspend" and "online_adspend"). However, we fail to reject the null for the "radio_adspend" variable (i.e., the effect is insignificant). 

The interpretation of the coefficients is as follows: 

* tv_adspend (&beta;<sub>1</sub>): when tv advertising expenditures increase by 1 Euro, sales will increase by 0.045 units
* online_adspend (&beta;<sub>2</sub>): when online advertising expenditures increase by 1 Euro, sales will increase by 0.187 units
* radio_adspend (&beta;<sub>3</sub>): when radio advertising expenditures increase by 1 Euro, sales will increase by -0.011 units

You should always provide a measure of uncertainty that is associated with the estimates. You could compute the confidence intervals around the coefficients using the ```confint()``` function.


```r
confint(linear_model)
```

```
##                      2.5 %     97.5 %
## (Intercept)     2.69771633 4.51056393
## tv_adspend      0.04254244 0.04841668
## online_adspend  0.16841843 0.20529924
## radio_adspend  -0.03246402 0.00952540
```

The results show that, for example, with a 95% probability the effect of online advertising will be between 0.172 and 0.211. 

Although the variables are measured on the same scale, you should still test the relative influence by inspecting the standardized coefficients that express the effects in terms of standard deviations.  


```r
library(lm.beta)
lm.beta(linear_model)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = sales ~ tv_adspend + online_adspend + radio_adspend, 
##     data = sales_data)
## 
## Standardized Coefficients::
##    (Intercept)     tv_adspend online_adspend  radio_adspend 
##     0.00000000     0.75566632     0.49556807    -0.02668878
```

Here, we conclude that tv advertising has the largest ROI followed by online advertising and radio advertising. 

Another significance test is the F-test. It tests the null hypothesis:

$$H_0: R^2=0$$

This is equivalent to the following null hypothesis: 

$$H_0: \beta_1=\beta_2=\beta_3=\beta_k=0$$

The result of the test is provided in the output above ("F-statistic: 363.7 on 3 and 236 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16"). Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients are zero. 

Regarding the model fit, the R<sup>2</sup> statistic tells us that approximately 82% of the variance can be explained by the model. This can be visualized as follows: 


```r
sales_data$yhat <- predict(linear_model)
ggplot(sales_data,aes(yhat,sales)) +  
  geom_point(size=2,shape=1) +  #Use hollow circles
  scale_x_continuous(name="predicted values") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="observed values") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) +
  theme_bw()
```

Of course, you could have also used the functions included in the ggstatsplot package to report the results from your regression model. 


```r
library(ggstatsplot)
options(scipen = 0)
# specify_decimal_p(0.00000000004, k = 3L,
# p.value = TRUE)
ggcoefstats(x = linear_model, k = 15, title = "Sales predicted by adspend, airplay, & starpower")
```

**Question 5**
  
Finally, we can predict the outcome for the given marketing mix using the following equation: 
  
$$\hat{sales}= 3.6 + 0.045*150 + 0.186*26 + 0.011*15 = 15.11$$

 
  

```r
summary(linear_model)$coefficients[1, 1] + summary(linear_model)$coefficients[2,
    1] * 150 + summary(linear_model)$coefficients[3,
    1] * 26 + summary(linear_model)$coefficients[4,
    1] * 15
```

```
## [1] 15.11236
```

This means that given the planned marketing mix, we would expect to sell around 15,112 units (recall that the variables are measured in thousands of units).
