# (PART) Group project {-}

# Survey design & analysis

## Your tasks

In this section you will find all information related to the group project. Generally, the group project comprises two parts:

1. **Questionnaire design & data collection**: In the first part, you will work with your group on creating a questionnaire. Once you have created a draft of your questionnaire, you will present the draft to us and we will provide feedback. After implementing the feedback, you will submit the final version of the questionnaire and start the data collection using an online survey. 
2. **Data analysis & presentation**: In the second part, you will apply the statistical knowledge acquired during the course to analyze your data and present your findings using a video recording and submit your report (data, R code, and video presentation).

Note that this assignment may require you to deal with and integrate
knowledge that has not yet been covered in class! Students are
expected to read ahead and collect additional information to the
extent to which their project requires this.
:::

## Topics for the group project

The first step is to select a topic from the list below. We will use an online survey, asking you to rank the top 5 topics that you would like to work on so that we can assign the topics according to your preferences. You can reach the online survey via [this link](https://wumarketing.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bIbbROWUholqvsi). Please note that only one person per group needs to fill out the survey after you discussed which topic to chose within your groups. If two or more groups have the same preference for a topic, we will select one group randomly and the other group will receive the next topic in the order of their preference.

Below, you can find the **list of topics** including a short description and some references to published studies on the respective topics that should help you with the design of your questionnaire. We expect you to read the stated papers and incorporate the relevant ascects into your own survey design.

2  | Drivers of green consumption  | **Topic:**<br />The climate debate is currently on the agenda of many news media outlets. Explore in how far consumers are willing to change their consumption behavior to help protect the environment when it comes to grocery shopping. What factors influence the willingness to change (e.g., social factors, convenience, quality)? What are barriers that hinder consumers from shopping more sustainable products. Select one specific product and explore the impact of front of package labels indicating the carbon footprint of a product on consumer choice and willingness-to-pay.

3 | Consumers’ willingness to pay for organic products | **Topic:**<br />Develop a questionnaire to measure consumers’ willingness to pay for organic products when it comes to groceries. Select one specific product and explore how much consumers are willing to pay for organic vs. conventional products? What is the observed price premium and what are its drivers? What dimensions can you identify when it comes to organic food preferences? For example, does it reflect a desire to achieve better health, eat better quality food, comply with social norms, or to contribute to environmental protection? What marketing messages are effective in stimulating demand for organic products?<br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Testa et al. (2021).

4 | Privacy in social media – consumers’ willingness to pay for a secure social network | **Topic:**<br />Over the last years, media reports about data leaks and questionable business practices through the exploitation of user data by social networks (e.g., Facebook) have increased. Develop a questionnaire to measure consumers’ willingness to pay for a social network that does not track online behavior and exploits this data for different purposes. WHat is the price premium users are willing to pay for privacy? What are the main consumers concerns when it comes to privacy on social media? What factors make users give up their privacy? Can you identify distinct consumer segments? for how much money would users be willing to give up their privacy?<br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Kokolakis, S. (2017).

5 | Consumers‘ attitude and willingness to pay for store brands | **Topic:**<br />Develop a questionnaire to measure consumers’ attitude towards and willingness to pay for store brands (e.g., “Clever”, “Billa”). Select specific product categories and explore if consumers are willing to pay more for the manufacturer’s brand than for the store brand? What factors affect consumers’ choice? Along which dimensions are private label brands perceived differently compared to store brands (e.g., quality, price)? Are there differences in consumer choice across different consumption settings (e.g., private consumption vs. social consumption with friends)?<br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Burton, S. et al.

6 | Front-of-package nutrition labels | **Topic:**<br />Frequent consumption of unhealthy foods can lead to overweight or obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The consequences of poor diets is putting a burden on health care systems and front-of-package labels have been proposed as a means to help consumers to gain a better understanding of the ingredients of a product. Develop a questionnaire to test how front-of-package nutrition labels affect consumer choice. Which type of label is most effective? <br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Ikonen, I. et al. (2020).

7 | Going and being vegan: consumers willingness to make the change | **Topic:**<br />More and more people are turning to a vegan diet for many reasons, including health, concerns about animal welfare or a desire to protect environment. Develop a questionnaire to measure consumers’ willingness to become a vegan and its drivers (e.g., health, environment, compassion for animals). Find out what dimensions underlie the decision making process. What type of messaging might change consumers attitude towards veganism? How large is the vegan segment, what characteristics does it have, and what are the implications for marketing?<br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Proveg (2021).

8 |  Consumers’ preference and attitude towards online grocery shopping | **Topic:**<br />More and more people use online grocery shopping services and new companies in this space provide fast and convenient delivery options (e.g., Jokr, Gurkerl.at). In addition, the Coronavirus outbreak has lead to an increase in online shopping adoption. Develop a questionnaire to measure consumers’ attitude and its drivers towards the online grocery shopping. How does online shopping compare to the conventional shopping experience across important dimensions (e.g., price, service, experience)? Are online channels a substitute or a complementary service to shopping in physical stores. What role does the speed of delivery play? In which situations is the online channels preferred and how large is the segment of online shoppers? Are there differences before, during and after the pandemic? What factors can explain the intention of consumers to continue using online shopping services in the future?<br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Frank, D. & A. Peschel. (2020).

10 | Consumers’ attitude towards legal video streaming providers and piracy | **Topic:**<br />Video streaming providers like Netflix record a continuous increase in registered users. On the other hand, illegal video streaming portals (e.g., Popcorn Time) are heavily used by other consumers. Develop a questionnaire to measure consumers’ attitude towards and drivers (e.g. occupation, gender, usage behavior etc.) of legal video streaming service usage. What could be reasons for piracy and how can pirates be converted to paying customers? What is the willingness-to-pay for legal video streaming services in the current form and what is the price that users would pay if the service features (e.g., content selection) would be improved? How large is the piracy segment?<br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Papies, D. & M. Clement (2008).

11 | Local vs. global brands | **Topic:**<br />Some researchers argue that the increasing globalization leads to the homogenization of consumer needs and desires across the globe and some companies address this trend with standardized global products. However, some consumers appear to prefer local brands over global brands. Develop a questionnaire that investigates the drivers of consumers’ attitudes toward global and local brands. How do consumers rate global vs. local brands on relevant dimensions with regard to product choice (price, quality, sustainability, etc.)? Select a product category and conduct an experiment to find out what marketing messages for local brands might lead to a more favorable outcome in terms of consumer choice when competing with global brands (use a fictitious brand to avoid confounding effects of existing brand preferences). Can you identify different segments of consumers?<br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Riefler, P. (2019). Local versus global food consumption: the role of brand authenticity.

12 | The impact of social distancing on student's learning experience and outcomes | **Topic:**<br />The recent COVID-19 pandemic affected virtually all aspects of people's lives. For university students, many courses that were previously delivered on campus switched to distance learning mode. Develop a questionnaire to assess how distance learning affects student's learning experiences. What are advantages and disadvantages of online teaching? How do students rate distance learning compared to in-person teaching on important dimensions with regard to the learning experience? What teaching aids are most helpful to students? What tools should teachers use to overcome the disadvantages? What mode of teaching would students prefer for the time after the pandemic?<br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Armstrong-Mensah, E. et al.

13 | Consumer preferences for fair-trade products in the apparel industry | **Topic:**<br />Develop a questionnaire to measure consumers’ preferences for sustainable brands and eco-fashion. How do consumers rate eco vs. standard brands on relevant dimensions with regard to product choice (price, quality, sustainability, style, etc.)? Select a specific product and conduct an experiment to find out what the price premium consumers are willing to pay for fair-trade products (use a fictitious brand to avoid confounding effects of existing brand preferences).

14 | Freemium business models in the music industry | **Topic:**<br />Many music streaming services (e.g., Spotify, YouTube) offer a baseline version free of charge to consumers but charge for a premium version with additional features. Develop a questionnaire to measure consumers’ willingness to pay for legal music streaming services. What factors (e.g., product range, sharing features, price, occupation, gender, usage behavior) drive the conversion  from the free tier of the service to the paid tier, and how could companies motivate consumers to convert to the premium version of the service? What is the market potential for paid music subscription services?<br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Wagner, T. & T. Hess (2013). What Drives Users to Pay for Freemium Services?

15 | Perceived influence of Social Media Influencers | **Topic:**<br />Confronted with declining effectiveness of traditional marketing channels, companies invest increasing amounts in Influencer Marketing, especially to reach a younger demographic. Develop a questionnaire to assess in which product categories influencer marketing is particularly prevalent. Can you identify changes in media consumption behavior that can explain why social media is so important to reach younger demographics (e.g., differences in media consumption patters across demographics). Conduct an experiment to find out the drivers of the perceived influence of social media Influencers. Particularly, you should investigate if the number of accounts that an Influencer follows affects the perceived influence of this influencer and the willingness to share the content for his/her followers. What could be moderators of these effects?<br /><br />**Literature:**<br />Valsesia, F., D. Proserpio, & J. Nunes (2020). The Positive Effect of Not Following Others on Social Media.

## General information

In this section, you can find some guidelines regarding the design of your questionnaire.

**Individual responsibility:**

* Group members should plan to share responsibilities equally
* All members of the group must contribute to the project
* Each student will receive an individual grade 
* To ensure an equal contribution of group members, a peer assessment will be conducted, which enters into the computation of the individual grades for the group project 

**Submission**

There are two grading components: 

* Questionnaire design & data collection: When you submit your questionnaire draft, please submit 1) the pdf printout from Qualtrics, 2) a short slide deck explaining your research problem and how you intend to solve it (research design, measurement & scaling, intended types of analyses). We will go through the presentation during the first coaching session. After this, you'll have time to revise the questionnaire based on the feedback that you received.
* Data analysis & presentation: When you submit your final presentation, please submit a .zip folder containing 1) the video recording, 2) the data, 3) the R code file, and 4) your slides. The code should be provided in a reproducible format, i.e., we should be able to reproduce your results by running the code.  

## Questionnaire design

### Guidelines for the submission and presentation

In the presentation of your questionnaire design, you should address the following points:

**Problem statement & research hypotheses**

* What is the research problem & why is it relevant from a managerial perspective?
* What research questions do you intend to answer with your research? What type are they (descriptive, preictive, causal inference)
* What are your hypotheses?
* What are the references that you used?

**Questionnaire structure & research design**

* Please provide a justification for the structure of your questionnaire
* Use appropriate wording in the questionnaire to obtain the desired information
* Provide explanations regarding your choice of research design to answer the research questions

**Reasons for variable selection & measurement and scaling**

* Please provide a justification of why you chose your variables and the associated choices regarding the measurement & scaling of these variables
* What are the expected relationships between the independent variable(s) and your dependent variable(s)?

**Plan your statistical analyses**

* Although we won't have covered all methods when you submit your questionnaire design, you should plan ahead and present some ideas on how you plan to analyze your data
* It is important to consider this before collecting your data, since the type of data you will obtain affects the type of methods you can use

### Guidelines for the design of your questionnaire

This section provides some information regarding the first part of the group project: questionnaire design & data collection. 

One aim of this course is to develop your ability to translate business problems into actionable research questions and to design an adequate research plan to answer these questions. Therefore, you need to be equipped with knowledge on how to create a survey and properly conduct a research. The following sections are meant to assist you with the questionnaire design process to avoid common pitfalls. 

#### Research design

<div style="text-align: justify">

As you aim to conduct a real marketing research, before you start writing down questions for a questionnaire, you need to come up with a research design. In particular, you should review the research questions and hypotheses to decide on which research design is appropriate. That is, if your research objective is descriptive, predictive, or to identify a causal relationship (see chapter 1).  

If you are interested in a **causal effect** of one particular (independent) variable on another (dependent) variable, an experimental design with random assignment of participants to the experimental groups is generally the best way to proceed. In this case, you particularly have to decide on the following:  

* Which variable to manipulate?  
* Whether to use a between-subjects or within-subjects design?  
* The cause-effect sequence (the cause must occur before the effect)  
* The number of experimental conditions  
* Potential interactions and relationships with other variables (does the effect depend on another variable?)

Here are some examples of causal research design applications:  

* To assess the effect of Front-of-package nutrition labels on product choice
* To assess the effect of different marketing messages on consumer attitudes and purchase intentions

If it is not feasible to run an experiment with random assignment (aka randomized controlled trial), you may still obtain non-experimental observational data from your survey to find answers to causal research questions. However, in this case you need to carefully consider whether there could be other variables (aka confounding factors) that may explain the relationship between the dependent and independent variables as the following figure shows.

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("causation-effect.png")
```

You should also carefully consider the direction of the hypothesized relationships of interest. Consider the example of a study analyzing the effect of the time that a person has been living in a city on the attitude that this person has towards that city. In this case, it could be that the living duration leads to a more positive attitude towards the city but it is just as well possible that a more positive attitude leads a person to stay in the city longer. Potentially bidirectional relationships like this naturally carry the risk of **reversed causation** and you should be certain when drafting your research design, that the effect only runs in one direction. 

In the case that you suspect that there could be potentially confounding variables, the best way would be to measure these variables in your survey and include them as control variables in your model. Consider the example of a study analyzing the effect of illegal movie streaming services (e.g., Popcorn Time) on paid movie streaming services (e.g., Netflix) and whether piracy harms movie revenues. If you would only measure the number of movies that someone consumes via illegal channels (independent variable) and via legal channels (dependent variables), you are likely to find a positive relationship. However, this does not mean that because someone uses illegal services, this person watches more movies via legal channels. Instead, it is likely that users with a high interest in movies in general have a higher consumption of both legal *and* illegal channels. In this case, if we would collect information about the general interest in movies and include this variable as a control variable, we may adjust for the general preference for movie products and the effect of illegal channels on legal channels might show a negative sign.   

If you would like to estimate the effects of multiple independent variables on one dependent variable as described above, you would need to use a regression model. In this case, you particularly have to decide on:  

* How to measure **the dependent variable (DV)**. This is particularly important, since you need a variable that is powerful in uncovering variation between subjects (e.g., ratio variables like "How much are you willing to pay for this product" are good candidates). Moreover, you also need to consider the nature of your DV, i.e., whether it is an continuous variable or a categorical variable. In the former case, you would run a linear regression model and in the latter case, you would run a logistic regression if the categorical variable only has two categories (i.e., it is a binary variable). Note that there are also models for categorical variables with more than two categories (e.g., ordinal regression) but we don't cover them here. 

* How to measure **the independent variables (IV)** (single-item vs. multi-item scales, categorical vs. continuous). In a regression model you may include nearly all of these variable types as independent variables. 

Bear in mind that the nature of the IV, together with DV, affects your choice of a statistical model as well. If you are uncertain, which model to use, you may check for example [this website](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/) by UCLA which not only shows which type of test is appropriate but also has R code available for each of these tests given the nature of the DV and IV.    

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("mlp-regression.png")
```

On a more general note, in many cases it is also interesting to think about potential interaction effects (e.g., is the effect of variable X stronger for group A vs. B?). It rarely happens that an effect of one variable on another is the same for all people and there is usually heterogeneity between them. It could even be that the main effect of one variable on another variable is insignificant because the effect is positive for one group of people and negative for another group of people so that the effects cancel each other out. 

#### Method of data collection  

In the next step you should review the method of data collection. For your group project, you will use an online survey, so this part does not require too much consideration. For the purpose of this course, we will provide you with a free [Qualtrics](http://www.qualtrics.com/free-account/) account, which you may use to program your questionnaire. Here is the list of the online tools you can use to conduct an online survey (usually for free) outside the scope of this course:  

* [Google form](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)
* [Survey monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)
* [Free online surverys](http://freeonlinesurveys.com/)
* [Kwik surveys](http://kwiksurveys.com/)

A questionnaire creation in Qualtrics starts with creation of a Qualtrics project. Each project consists of a survey, distribution record, and collection of responses and reports. There are three ways to create a questionnaire. First, you can create a new survey project from scratch. Second, you can create a new questionnaire from a copy of an existing questionnaire. Eventually, you can create from a template in your Survey Library, or from an exported QSF file.

### Questionnaire structure and contents

Your task is to develop a questionnaire with approx. 30 questions (5 questions per person in your group) and there are some important things to keep in mind while developing a questionnaire, which will be highlighted in this section. 

#### General structure

The sequence of questions in a questionnaire plays an important role. Your questionnaire will usually start with an introductory page with a call-to-action to fill out the survey and a brief statement regarding the details about the survey (e.g., topic, duration). Not that you should carefully consider how much information you would like to disclose about the goal of the survey. If respondents are aware of the goal of the survey, they might strategically answer to influence the results. 

After the introduction, it is usually a good idea to collect some information about the topic of your survey that you can later use to present descriptive statistics. At the same time, this is a good opportunity to familiarize the participants with the survey topic. For example, in a survey about store brands, you may show some logos of store brands and ask the respondents which store brands they know or purchase using a multiple-choice question. 

After the introductory questions you may proceed to collect information about your dependent and independent variables. If your research design contains an experimental manipulation, you need to carefully consider at which part of the questionnaire you will include the manipulation. The reason is that all questions that respondents answer after the manipulation may be influenced by it. It is usually a good idea to include most independent variables before the manipulation, while the dependent variable needs to be measured after the manipulation. 

Demographics (e.g., age, gender) should generally be included at the end of the questionnaire because these questions usually require less cognitive effort so that respondents can answer them reliably even at the end of the survey. It is also recommended to include sensitive questions at the end of the questionnaire since sensitive questions may lead respondents to exit the survey.

You should also think about the respondent's experience. For instance, it is usually better to spread the content over more short pages than have fewer long pages. Generally, respondents are reluctant to read and fill out long questionnaire pages. Hence, long pages will lead to a higher dropout rate. In order to reduce the dropout rate, you should state how long the survey will approximately in the introduction of the questionnaire. 

::: {.infobox_red .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
Consider that the most of people usually use their phones to fill it out. Think about how the questionnaire will appear on a phone screen too. In that regard, think of length of questions especially. It should generally not take longer than 10 minutes to fill out the survey (depending on the incentive). 
:::

Finally, the questionnaire structure should be aligned with the research design. For example, if your research design features an experiment, this needs to be reflected in the questionnaire (e.g., you need to assign the respondents randomly to the experimental conditions in case of a between-subjects comparison).

##### Questionnaire structure for experimental designs

**Questionnaire structure for a between-subjects experimental design**

In a between-subject design you randomly assign each respondent to different experimental conditions. They would then complete tasks only in the condition to which they are assigned.

Consider the example of a survey analyzing the effect of different versions of an advertisement on purchase intention. Thus, one group of (randomly assigned) respondents will be exposed to one advertisement version while the other group (of randomly assigned respondents) will be exposed to another version. After that, both groups of respondents should express their intention to purchase the advertised product as shown in the following figure:

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('between-subject-design.png')
```

**Setting a randomizer in Qualtrics**

Here is a short description of how to set up a randomizer in Qualtrics, so that your participants are going to be assigned either to specific conditions.

First, navigate to the Survey tab and open your Survey Flow.

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/surveyflow1.png')
```

Then click Add Below or Add a New Element Here, depending to where you want to place a randomizer. 

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/surveyflow2.png')
```
Then choose Randomizer.

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/surveyflow3.png')
```

Finally, you set the number (the one between - and +) to 1 and check the option "Evenly Present Elements". Next you edit embedded data fields by naming it (e.g., "Group" and "Control","Test Group 1","Test Group 2".)


```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/surveyflow4.png')
```

It is very important to think about the place to set a randomizer in a survey workflow. You want to place it always before you branch your survey flow, so that you can keep track of which respondent was exposed to which condition. If you do not set a randomizer before branching, it would remain unknown what condition each respondent was exposed to. Here is how it was done in our example of Qualtrics survey.

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/surveyflow7.png')
```

After respondents are randomly assigned either to a specific condition, the embedded data field can be used as a criterion for branching, i.e., asking respondents in a condition A and B different block of questions.

**Questionnaire structure for a within-subjects experimental design**

This type of experimental design involves exposing each respondent to all experimental conditions you’re testing.

For instance, we would like to test again the effect of two versions of an advertisement on purchase intentions, but this time in a within-subject design. First, each respondent will be exposed to the first version of advertisement and right after that asked to rate his/her intention to buy the advertised product. Subsequently, each participant will be shown another version of advertisement and again rate his/her intention to purchase the advertised product as shown in the figure below. 

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('within-subject-design.png')
```

#### General contents

In this section, we will discuss some important issues regarding the contents of your questions. Generally, how you phrase the question impacts the reliability and validity of your variables, i.e., if it is possible for the respondent to understand what we intended to measure and whether the measure consistently measures the same variable across respondents.

First, we will briefly highlight some points regarding the language and wording:

* Aim for **brevity & use simple language** and avoid technical terms
* Don't use more questions then needed (usually **respondents' fatigue** increases when many questions with the same contents are included)
* Avoid asking **double-barreled questions**, i.e., a single question covering two issues (e.g., instead of asking "Do you think Nike Town offers better variety and prices than other Nike stores?"; --> ask for price and variety separately)
* Make sure that your **respondents are able** to meaningfully answer your questions (e.g., asking for an opinion about a topic that the respondent may not be familiar with; --> include a "don't know" option; it is better than obtaining unreliable information)   
* When asking participants to recall e.g., certain brands, decide between **unaided and aided recall questions** (unaided means you do not show the possible response option, which is harder but may also provide more valuable information)
* Use **different question types** to avoid respondent fatigue
* When asking participants to list something, **minimize the effort required by respondents** (e.g., open-ended questions like "Please list all the departments from which you purchased merchandise on your most recent shopping trip to department store X." require more effort compared to providing the response options in the form of a multiple-choice question)
* When asking for **information that could be considered sensitive** (e.g. income, political beliefs), they should come at the end of the questionnaire and in form of response categories, rather than asking for specific figures (e.g., instead of asking the exact income, ask for income categories)  
* **Avoid leading questions** that provide clues to what the answer should be and induce bias in a particular direction (e.g., ask “What is your favorite brand of toothpaste?” instead of “Is Colgate your favorite toothpaste?”). 
* **Avoid ambiguous words** such as usually, normally, frequently, often, regularly, and other similar words that do not define frequency clearly enough.

#### Measurement scales and scaling techniques

Every statistical analysis requires that variables have a specific levels of measurement (i.e., categorical = nominal & ordinal; continuous = interval & ratio). The measurement scales you choose for your questions in a survey will affect the answers you get and eventually determines the choice of statistical test you can apply. The flow chart below should help you to choosing a correct measurement scale for your variables depending on which type of analyses you plan to conduct. [Here](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/) you can find another overview of statistical test associated with different types of independent and dependent variables. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%',fig.align='center',fig.cap = "Flow chart for method selection (McElreath 2015)"}
knitr::include_graphics("overview-statistical-test.jpg")
```

When it comes to **scaling techniques**, they are meant to study the relationship between objects. The basic scaling techniques classification is on **comparative** and **non-comparative scales**. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("scales.png")
```

##### Non-comparative scales

For non-comparative scales, each object is scaled independently of the other objects. The resulting data is supposed to be measured in an interval and ratio scaled. 

**Itemized rating scales**

One of the most frequently used type of non-comparative scales are itemized rating scales:  

* The respondents are provided with a scale that has a number or brief description associated with each category.  
* The categories are ordered in terms of scale position, and the respondents are required to select the specified category that best describes the object being rated.  
* The commonly used itemized rating scales are **the Likert scale and the semantic differential**

A **Likert scale** has the following properties:

* Requires respondents to indicate their attitude towards the given object through the degree of agreement or disagreement with each of a series of statements within typically five or seven categories.  
* Reversed code of some items increases validity.  
* One limitation is time required to answer a question on a Likert scale. Compared to other itemized scaling techniques, Likert scale is more time consuming as each respondent is required to read every statement given in a questionnaire before assigning a numerical value to it.

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('likert.png')
```

In the table below you can find a couple of commonly measured constructs in marketing research such as attitude, importance, purchase intention and similar.

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('likert-marketing-reserach.png')
```

**Semantic Differential**

A semantic differential scale has the following properties:

* Typically, participants rate objects on a number of itemized, seven-point rating scales bounded at each end by one of two bipolar adjectives.  
* Semantic differential can measure respondent attitudes towards something (products,concepts, items, people...).
* It helps you find the respondent's position is on a scale between two bipolar adjectives such as “Sweet-Sour” or “Bright-Dark”. In comparison to Likert scale, which uses generic scales (e.g. extremely dissatisfied to extremely satisfied), semantic differential questions are posed within the context of evaluating attitudes.
* Widely used rating scale in marketing research due to its versatility

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='left',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('semantic-differential.png')
```

When using itemized rating questions (Likert and semantic differential), you should consider the following:

* **Number of categories:** 

Generally, there is no optimal number but the most frequently used number of categories are 5 and 7, depending on the context (e.g., how detailed the question can be answered). 

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='left',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('semantic-differential-1.png')
```

* **Balanced vs. unbalanced:**

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='left',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('semantic-differential-2.png')
```

* **Odd/even number of categories:**

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='left',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('semantic-differential-3.png')
```

* **Forced vs. non-forced response**

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='left',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('semantic-differential-4.png')
```

* **Verbal description:**

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='left',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('semantic-differential-5.png')
```

**Continuous Rating Scales**

* Participants rate the objects by placing a mark at the appropriate position on a line that runs from one extreme of the criterion variable to the other.  
* One of the advantages of the continuous rating scale is that it is easy to administer. 
* Once the ratings are collected, you also have the option of splitting up the obtained ratings into categories and then assign those depending on the category in which the ratings fall.

You can see one example for a continuous rating scale below:

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/cont_scale_fin.PNG')
```

##### Comparative scales

Comparative scales (or non-metric scaling) compare the stimulus object directly. As a result, the comparative data collected can only be interpreted in relative terms. In this section we will walk through the most important comparative scale types.

**Rank order**  

A rank order question asks respondents to compare items to each other by placing them in order of preference. Note that the data obtained from a rank order question shows an order of a respondent's preference, but not the difference between items. In the example below, if it turns out that the most important feature of a fitness tracker for a respondent is "Measuring steps" and the second most important feature "Calories burned", we don't know for how much more important is the former one in comparison to the latter one. 

* *Example:*  
```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%', fig.cap="Rank order question"}
knitr::include_graphics('rank-order-question.png')
```


**Constant sum**  

Using a constant sum question, respondents allocate a constant sum of units (e.g., points, dollars) among a set of stimulus objects with respect to some criterion. Thus, if you wish to obtain information about how much one attribute is preferred over another one, you may use a constant sum scale. The total box should always be displayed at the bottom to make it easier for respondents. A constant sum question permits collection of ratio data type. Constant sum is similar to rank order, but it carries specific units. With the data collected we are able to answer the question: what factor is the most important for our respondents when they go out for a dinner? With data obtained we would be able to express the relative importance of the options. 

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%', fig.cap="Constant sum question"}
knitr::include_graphics('constant-sum-question.png')
```

#### Other frequently used question types

In this section, we present some examples of the most frequent types of questions students use.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE ,error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load in qualtRics package
library(qualtRics)
library(janitor)
library(sjlabelled)
library(kableExtra)
# Read the qualtrics survey data
qualtrics<-read_survey('data_analysis_survey.csv')
# Using labels as column name
new.colnames <-colnames(label_to_colnames(qualtrics))
new.colnames <- make.unique(new.colnames, sep="_")
colnames(qualtrics)<- new.colnames
```

##### Single choice question

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%', fig.cap="Multiple choice question with single answer"}
knitr::include_graphics('support-multiple-choice-question.png')
```

##### Multiple choice question

Multiple Choice with a single answer is a type of closed-ended question that lets respondents select **one answer** from a defined list of choices.Type of data you obtain is **categorical.** 

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%',fig.cap="Multiple choice question with multiple answers"}
knitr::include_graphics('multiple-choice-question-multiple-answers.png')
```

It is important to distinguish multiple choice questions with single and multiple answers (which will be presented later) as their analysis looks differently.

##### Number entry question

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%', fig.cap="Text or number entry question"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/text-entry.PNG')
```
A number entry question is a recommended type of question if you are interested in obtaining **ratio data type**. Ratio data type gives you flexibility to apply a broad range of statistical analyses such as regression analysis, correlation computation, t-test (or ANOVA), or factor analysis. Data collected by number entry question is handy to use with data collected by slider questions or with a constant sum question. Note that in this case we treat constant sum data as ratio data and therefore assume that 0 means complete absence.

### Test your questionnaire

Finally, before you distribute the questionnaire, there are some things to consider. First, you should always pretest your questionnaire before you start to collect data. Double-check all aspects of the questionnaire (content, wording, sequence, form & layout, etc.). If possible, use test-respondents in the pretest that are similar to those who will be included in the actual survey. After each significant revision of the questionnaire, conduct another pretest, using a different sample of respondents. 

After pretesting your questionnaire you should be able to determine whether:

* The questions are properly framed  
* The questions wording triggers any biases  
* The questions are placed in the optimal order  
* The questions are understandable  
* Specifying questions are needed or some need to be eliminated  

Here are some more useful hints when setting up an online questionnaire:

* Add a progress bar so that respondents know how many pages are left (see "Look & Feel" menu in Qualtrics).
* Remember to activate the "Force Response" field under "Validation Options" if you don't want to allow respondents to skip questions.
* Check the usability on mobile devices using the preview option (make sure the "Mobile friendly" option is checked).


## Part 2: Data collection and analysis

The following type of visualization includes statistical test as well:
  
### Collecting data

Your task in this part is to collect real data from real people. More specifically, 
each group member is supposed to administer the questionnaire to 20 persons, i.e. a group of 6 = 120 people per group project.

### Data analysis


#### Data analysis & presentation

For your data analysis & final presentation, you should consider the following points:

**Problem statement**

* Be clear about the problem that you are trying to solve or the research question(s) you would like to answer
* Why is the problem relevant from a managerial perspective?

**Presentation structure**

* Think about the overall structure of your presentation before you start designing the individual slides.
* Given your research problem/question, what slides/content do you need to have in the presentation to answer your research question or solve your problem?
* Please don’t include an accumulation of visualizations that lead nowhere. Instead, ask yourself, is this chart contributing to the answer of your research question?
* It is usually a good idea to start with an introduction to the topic and the research question(s). Next, you may describe and justify your research design (e.g., causal inference vs. predictive vs. descriptive) that you chose to address the research questions(s). After that, you should provide some descriptive statistics about your sample. In a next step, you should present your results regarding the central research questions. Remember to include all the necessary information that are required to understand the results (e.g., number of observations, wording of questions, etc.). It is usually a good idea to include appropriate visualizations of the variables that you are investigating. You do not need to include all assumption tests for the methods in the main body of the presentation. However, you should still test if the assumptions are met and include the results in the appendix in case there are questions. Finally, you should discuss/interpret your results with regard to the managerial research question(s) and list potential limitations of your research.

**Choice of appropriate statistical tests**

* Please provide a justification for the choice of statistical test (e.g., t-test, regression, ANOVA, parametric vs. non-parametric) given your choices regarding the types of variables.
* Remember to use the correct terminology and e.g., state the dependent and independent variables.
* If you use a regression model, also include a formal statement of the regression equation so it is clear what is being analyzed, e.g., $log(DV)=\beta_0+\beta_1*log(IDV1)+\beta_2*log(IDV2)+\epsilon$. From the regression equation, it should be clear what type of model it is (linear regression vs. logistic regression), what the dependent variable is, what the independent variables are, and whether the values are transformed (e.g., logarithms) or not.
* If your analyses include multiple steps, make sure that it is clear to the audience why the individual steps were conducted and how they relate to each other (e.g., if you do a PCA first to reduce the dimensionality of the data and then include the resulting factor scores in a regression model, make sure that the purpose of each step is clear).

**Implementation of analysis**

* Make sure that you store the R code you used for your analysis and submit it along with your data & the slides to the assignment on Learn. This way, it is transparent how you arrived at your results.
* We should be able to replicate your results by running the code.

**Visualizations**

* Select appropriate plots to visualize your variables (e.g., scatter plot, boxplot, mean plot, histogram)
* Not every visualization that you could potentially come up with really makes sense to put into a presentation. Again, ask yourself, is this chart contributing to the answer of your research question(s)?
* Do not forget legends and labels of the axes in your visualization!
* Remember to include all information that are required to understand the visualization (e.g., the wording of the question, the number of observations, axis labels)
* Keep it simple and make sure that a visualization can be easily understood. Adding too much information into a visualization is very often misleading for your audience and hurts more than you might think.
* In case a visualization is not easily comprehensible, you might think about adding a note that explains the audience how-to-read the visualization using an example.

**Reporting and interpretation of model results**

* Report your analysis in an appropriate way (e.g., use the ‘stargazer’ package to report the results of regression models or use the ‘ggstatsplot’ package to provide test summaries).
* Interpret all relevant test statistics (e.g., test statistics, confidence intervals, coefficients and their significance and relative importance, R-squared, effect sizes, etc.).
* Discuss the recommendations derived from analysis. Do not skip this part! Always assume that you have an audience of decision makers. You need to tell them what to do based on your analysis.

```

In this chapter we will encounter the nature of data you collect when conducting a survey. It will help you in handling your survey data in R, and show you which statistical tests you might apply. Note that in focus of this chapter are not statistical test as they are extensively discussed in the previous chapters.

::: {.infobox_red .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
The purpose of this chapter is primary to help you handle and determine data types from your Qualtrics survey. For more information in regards to what statistical tests to use, assumptions or other details, please consult relevant chapters. 
:::

#### Load in a Qualtrics survey data via package "qualtRics" {-}

After downloading your survey in CSV format, you need to install `qualtRics` and load it in.

```{r, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE , warning=FALSE ,error=FALSE}
# Load in qualtRics package
# install.packages("qualtRics")
library(sjlabelled)
library(qualtRics)
```

`read_survey()` is a function that loads in survey results in CSV to R.

```{r, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE ,error=FALSE}
# Read the qualtrics survey data
qualtrics<-read_survey('data_analysis_survey.csv')
head(qualtrics,3)
```
Current column names are not much helpful in identifying questions from the questionnaire. In order to name columns after corresponding question, the function `label_to_colnames()` from package `sjlabelled` can help. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, results='asis', warning=FALSE ,error=FALSE}
# Using labels as column name
new.colnames <-colnames(label_to_colnames(qualtrics))
```

As it can happen that two or more column names are identical, we can use `make.unique()` function to assign different names to columns that are supposed to have same names. For instance, in our case it is column name 'Selected choice' that appears twice for two different questions. After we run the function, the resulting names will be 'Selected choice' and 'Selected choice_1'. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE ,error=FALSE}
new.colnames <- make.unique(new.colnames, sep="_")
```

Finally, we can assign unique corresponding names to the columns in our survey data.

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE ,error=FALSE}
colnames(qualtrics)<- new.colnames
head(qualtrics,3)
```

) you can find a brief, but insightful Introduction to qualtRics package and how to combine Qualtrics and R
:::


#### Multiple choice with a single answer {-}

Type of data you obtain is **categorical**, and the output comes in the following form:  

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, fig.align='center',eval=TRUE}
qualtrics[1:6,c("During a typical day, in what period of the day you prefer watching movies or TV series on Netflix?")] %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```


What to do with this data now? First, we need to load it in R and prepare for analysis. The numbers you see in the output R recognizes **as numeric**. In order to conduct statistical modeling and properly visualize our results, we need to convert our data to **a factor class.**

A factor (or coding variable) represents different groups of data by using numbers (integers). In fact, factors appear as numeric variables, but they hold meaning of labels/names of data groups, i.e. nominal variable. These data groups are represented in a form of 'levels'.  
In our case, our multiple choice question output will contain 5 data groups after converting it to factor:

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,}
# Convert numeric value to factors
qualtrics$`During a typical day, in what period of the day you prefer watching movies or TV series on Netflix?` <- factor(qualtrics$`During a typical day, in what period of the day you prefer watching movies or TV series on Netflix?`, levels = c(1:5), labels = c('Never','Early morning(00:00-06:00)','Morning(06:00-12:00)','Afternoon(12:00-18:00','Evening (18:00-22:00)'))
# Table
table(qualtrics$`During a typical day, in what period of the day you prefer watching movies or TV series on Netflix?`)
```

##### Fischer's exact

Fisher's exact test is used to test a hypothesis with data obtained from multiple choice questions with single answer. Results from multiple choice questions with multiple answers are treated with different test.
<ul><li> <B> Application: </B> when you have <B> 1 dependent variable and  1 independent variable with 2 or more levels/factors </B></ul></li>
<ul><li> Used when frequency in at least one cell is <B> less than 5 </B>. When frequencies in each cell are greater than 5, Chi-square test should be used.</ul></li>
<ul><li> <B>Hypothesis:</B> Is there a significant difference in frequencies between values observed in cells and values expected in cells ? </ul></li>
<ul><li> <B>H0:</B> There is no relationship between the two categorical variables.Therefore, two categorical variables are <B> independent.</B> Knowing the value of one variable does not help to predict the value of the other variable.</ul></li>
<ul><li> <B>H1:</B> There is a relationship between the two categorical variables.Therefore, two categorical variables are <B> dependent.</B>Knowing the value of one variable helps to predict the value of the other variable.</ul></li>
<ul><li> Usually, this type of test is used on 2x2 contingency tables. However, it can be applicable on contingency tables of larger dimensions.</ul></li>

<B>Example:</B> We would like to know whether the preferred period of the day for watching Netflix depends on the respondents' country of origin.


```{r}

# Converting characters to factors
#qualtrics$`What is your gender? - Selected Choice` <- factor(qualtrics$`What is your gender? - Selected Choice`,levels = c(1:2),labels = c("Male","Female"))
#qualtrics$`What is your country of origin? - Selected Choice` <- factor(qualtrics$`What is your country of origin? - Selected Choice`, levels = c(1:2), labels=c("Austria","Germany"))
# Creation of contingency table
#fisher_test_table <-table(qualtrics$`What is your country of origin? - Selected Choice`,qualtrics$`During a typical day, in what period of the day you prefer watching movies or TV series on Netflix?`)
# Since we have a count less than 5, we should apply Fisher's test instead of Chi-square.
# Fisher's test
#test <- fisher.test(fisher_test_table)
#test
```

From the output and from `test$p.value` we see that the p-value is higher than the significance level of 5%. Like any other statistical test, if the p-value is higher than the significance level, we can not reject the null hypothesis.

In our case, not rejecting the null hypothesis for the Fisher’s exact test of independence means that there is no significant relationship between the two categorical variables. Therefore, knowing the value of one variable does not help to predict the value of the other variable.

##### Chi-square test: Goodness of fit & Independence test {-}

1) Goodness of fit
<div><ul><li><B> Application: </B>when you only have <B> 1 dependent variable and none independent variables </B></ul></li>

<ul><li><B> Note that we did not assume any specific distribution, so we are assuming that each count will have the same or similar number. </ul></li></B>

```{r} 
# Creating table 
mlc_chi_square <- table(qualtrics$`During a typical day, in what period of the day you prefer watching movies or TV series on Netflix?`)
      
# Chi-square test (without given expected values = equal values )
chisq.test(mlc_chi_square)
```

The p-value of the test is higher than 0.05. We can conclude that the numbers of respondents who watch Netflix in different periods of a day are commonly distributed. Observed distribution does not differ significantly from the expected. This result does not surprise if you take a look at the values for each level in the table we created before conducting the test. There you can see that count of answers in each level is more or less not deviating too much. It is visible if you take a look at the previous visualizations as well.

If we are interested in testing more specific distribution, i.e. expect that 40% of our respondents are watching Netflix during evening hours, we can introduce corresponding distribution in the test. 
```{r}
# Expected values in percentages for each alternative. The sum must be 1.
expected_values <- c(0.10, # We expect that 10% of our respondents do not watch Netflix at all.
                     0.20, # We expect that 20% of our respondents watch Netflix in early morning.
                     0.10, # We expect that 10% of our respondents watch Netflix in morning.
                     0.20, # We expect that 20% of our respondents watch Netflix in afternoon.
                     0.40  # We expect that 40% of our respondents watch Netflix in evening.
                    )
# Chi-square test with expected values
chisq.test(mlc_chi_square, p=expected_values)
```

This time the p-value of the test is lower than 0.05. We have an evidence that observed distribution does significantly differ from the expected distribution (10%/20%/10%/20%/40%).  


2) Chi-Square Test of Independence
Application:when you have 1 dependent variable and  1 independent variable with 2 or more levels/factors 
Hypothesis: Is there an association between categorical variable X and categorical variable Y?
H0: There is no association between the two variables.
H1: There is an association between the two variables.
Example: Is there an association between gender and the preferred period of a day for watching Netflix? 

```{r}
# Creation of contingency table
#chi_square_table <-table(qualtrics$`What is your gender? - Selected Choice`,qualtrics$'During a typical day, in what period of the day you prefer watching movies or TV series on Netflix?')
# Chi-square independence test
#chisq.test(chi_square_table)
```

Since the p-value (0.8135) is higher than the significance level (0.05), we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Thus, we conclude that there is no association relationship between gender and the preferred period of a day for watching Netflix. Therefore, we can say that the hours spent is independent from the gender of participant.

#### Multiple choice with multiple answers {-}

In Qualtrics, multiple answers on multiple choice questions are captured in separate columns. For instance, the second respondents chose "Ja!Natürlich" and "Clever" as answers, thus, the rest of alternatives have none value in this row.

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, fig.align='center',eval=TRUE}
qualtrics[1:6,c(38,39,40,41)] %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

Since this type of question provides multiple possible answers, one way to analyze data obtained from this question is in the following form:

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Replacing NA with 0
#qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - ja! Natürlich.`[is.na(qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - ja! Natürlich.`)]=0
#qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - Clever`[is.na(qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - Clever`)]=0
#qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - Spar Vital`[is.na(qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - Spar Vital`)]=0
#qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - ...`[is.na(qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - ...`)]=0
# qualtrics[38] accesses ja!Natürlich column
# qualtrics[39] accesses Clever column
# qualtrics[40] accesses  Spar Vital column
# qualtrics[41] accesses ... column
# Calculating frequency, percentage of respondents and percentage of cases
#df.cochran <- data.frame(Frequnecy = colSums(qualtrics[38:41]),
#                         Share_of_respondents = (colSums(qualtrics[38:41])/sum(qualtrics[38:41]))*100,
#                                Share_of_cases =((colSums(qualtrics[38:41]))/nrow(qualtrics[38:41]))*100)
#df.cochran %>%
#  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
#  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

The share of cases column suggests that, for instance, almost 70% percent of people are familiar with the brand "ja!Naturlich". 

For the analysis of results collected with multiple choice question with multiple possible answers, we can use **Cochran's Q test.**Although we did not mention it before, it is not too different from what you have already learned about other tests. 

The Cochran’s Q test and associated multiple comparisons require the following assumptions:  

1. Responses are dichotomous and from k number of matched samples.  

2. The subjects are independent of one another and were selected at random from a larger population.  

3. The sample size is sufficiently “large”. (As a rule of thumb, the number of subjects for which the responses are not all 0’s or 1’s, n, should be ≥ 4 and nk should be ≥ 24)  

In a within-subjects experiment design with three or more observations of a dichotomous(= just two levels such as "Yes" or "No") categorical outcome, you utilize Cochran's Q test to assess main effects. Similarly, in a multiple choice question with multiple answers we have the same respondent going through three or more potential answers with dichotomous(=yes or no) categorical outcome, meaning that responses are **not independent from each other.** 

```{r}
library(DescTools)
#list.cochran <- list(qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - ja! Natürlich.`,
#                   qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - Clever`,
#                   qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - Spar Vital`,
#                   qualtrics$`Which of the following store brands do you know? (multiple answers possible) - ...`) # imaginary brand
# Replacing NAs in the list with 0 in order to be able to run the test
#list.cochran <- rapply(list.cochran, f=function(x) ifelse(is.na(x),0,x), how="replace" )
# Cochran test
#matrix.cochran <- do.call(cbind,list.cochran)
#DescTools::CochranQTest(matrix.cochran, alpha=0.05)
```
The p-value less than 0.05 indicates that there is enough evidence to conclude that some of the store brands are better known among our respondents than other. In order to take a closer look at it, we need to conduct a post hoc test.

```{r}
# Post hoc test (Dunn Test)
#DunnTest(list.cochran, method="bonferroni")
```

From the results of the Dunn Test, we can see that there is a big difference between 1 ("ja!Natürlich") and 4("..."), as well as between 4("...") and 3("Spar Vital"). 

#### Rank order question

Intuitive question to ask when it comes to this type of question is the following: which feature is the most important for respondents?

We can answer this question by calculating a mean rank for each feature. Before we do so, we will create a separate data frame and add columns of the response data.

```{r}
rank.data <- subset(qualtrics, select = stringr::str_detect(names(qualtrics),"Measuring steps|Calories burned|Measuring heartbeat|Exercise tracking|Measuring distance")) 
head(rank.data)%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

First information we would like to know is how many preference combinations there are, and how repetitive they are. We can obtain that information by creating a summary of the ranking data frame we created. 

```{r}
library(pmr)
test <- rankagg(rank.data)
test
```



The matrix we received as an output is the summary of our ranking data. It shows that, for instance, the preference combination "2,1,3,4,5" repeats 10 times in the data frame. More specifically, it means that there are 10 respondents who prefer the item 2("Calories burned") the most, then the item 1("Measuring steps"), and so on.

Now we can calculate the mean rank for each feature and conclude which feature is the most important to our respondents:

```{r}
# Mean rank of each fitness tracker feature
destat(test)$mean.rank
```

As we can observe from the output, the item 1("Measuring steps") shows the best mean rank among all items. Therefore, we can assume that the "Measuring steps" is most important for our respondents. However, in order to statistically prove it and become sure that this is not just by mere chance, we can conduct **Friedman rank sum test**.

Friedman rank sum test is used to identify whether there are any statistically significant differences between the distributions of 3 or more paired groups. It is used when the normality assumptions for using one-way repeated measures ANOVA are not met. Another case when Friedman rank rum test is used is when the dependent variable is measured on an ordinal scale, as in our case.

```{r}
# Friedman test 
friedman.test(as.matrix(rank.data))
```

Friedman rank sum test has a p-value lower than 0.05, so we can conclude that here are significant differences between at least two features (what we have already seen in our visualization). Even though we have identified differences between preferences towards features in our advanced visualization, we will conduct a post hoc test in order to demonstrate traditional way of calculating pairwise comparisons.


```{r,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(rstatix)
rank.data.long <- reshape2::melt(rank.data,value.name = "Rank",variable.name = "Feature", stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
posthoc <- wilcox_test(Rank ~ Feature, paired = TRUE, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni", data = rank.data.long)
posthoc%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```
The output table provides us with p-values referring to significance of difference in mean ranks of each pair. For instance, the first 4 rows  proves that the differences between the mean rank of the feature "Measuring steps" and each of the rest of features are significant. Consequently, we can conclude that this feature is by far the most important among our respondents. 

Another question that may be interesting to explore is whether there are any complementary features ? Or features which overlap each other in its functionality? In order to have a look at that, we can investigate the correlation between ranks assigned to each feature.

```{r}
#Correlation Matrix
cor.matrix<-cor(rank.data, method=c('spearman'))
cor.matrix
```

At the first glance we can observe a lot of negative values, meaning that many features correlate negatively relative to each other. In order to make the interpretation easier, we will try to visualise correlations in a form of a correlation matrix.

```{r}
library(ggcorrplot)
ggcorrplot(cor.matrix)
```

From the correlation matrix we can confirm that almost all features negatively correlate to each other. An exception is the relationship between feature "Measuring steps" and "Exercise tracking", which correlates positively. This matrix can be useful for digging deeper in relationship between preferences for features. For instance, we can assume that feature "Measuring steps" and "Exercise tracking" correlate positively because users see them as complementary features. Moreover, if we say that walking is a type of exercise (in case of longer walking routes), we can assume that users, who ranked "Exercise tracking" high, ranked "Measuring steps" high as well, because they perceive it as another type of "Exercise tracking".

#### Constant Sum question

If you wish to obtain information about how much one attribute is preferred over another one, you may use a constant sum scale. The total box should always be displayed at the bottom to make it easier for respondents. A constant sum question permits collection of ratio data type. With data obtained we would be able to express the relative importance of the options.

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(robCompositions)
constant.sum <- subset(qualtrics, select = stringr::str_detect(names(qualtrics), paste0(c(" Location"," Price"," Ambience"," Customer Service"), collapse = "|")))

constant.sum$id <- seq(1:nrow(constant.sum))
constant.sum[1:6,] %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

By computing descriptive statistics per column we get very useful insight in our data: 

```{r}
# Compute descriptive statistics
library(pastecs) 
res <- stat.desc(constant.sum)
round(res[,1:4],2) %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```


With the data collected we are able to answer the question: what factor is the most important for our respondents when they go out for a dinner?

In order to answer this question we need to conduct **a repeated measures ANOVA**.
This type of ANOVA is used for analyzing data where the same subjects are measured more than once. In our case we have every respondent measured on each of the factors (locations, price, ambiance and customer service). Repeated measures ANOVA is an extension of the paired-samples t-test. This test is also referred to as a within-subjects ANOVA. In the within-subject experimental design the same individuals are measured on the same outcome variable under different time points or conditions.

We need to check all assumptions that need to be fulfilled in order to deploy this type of ANOVA. There are three assumptions that need to check. The first to check that each level of the independent variable is approximately normally distributed. Since we have more than 30 observations at each level, we do not need to proceed further due to the central limit theorem. Second assumption refers to extreme outliers. Let's have a look at potential outliers:

```{r,error=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Creation of the long version of data frame
library(reshape2)
constant.sum.long <-melt(constant.sum[,-5], variable.name ="Factor" ,value.name = "Points")
# Outliers
constant.sum.long %>% 
  group_by(Factor) %>%
  identify_outliers(Points)%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

The p value seems to be significant, i.e., less than 0.05. As we cannot identify any extreme outliers, we can proceed with deploying repeated measures ANOVA.

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# Formatting data 
constant.sum.aov <- gather(constant.sum, key = "Factor", value = "Points",names(constant.sum)[stringr::str_detect(names(constant.sum), "Location|Price|Ambience|Customer Service")])
# One-way repeated measures ANOVA  
res.aov <- anova_test(data = constant.sum.aov, dv = Points, wid = id ,within = Factor)
get_anova_table(res.aov)%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```
As we know that ANOVA is an omnibus test, we need to conduct post hoc test for further details:

```{r}
# Post hoc test
pairwise.t.test(constant.sum.long$Points,constant.sum.long$Factor, paired = T, p.adjust.method = "holm")
```

Now we can clearly see that difference between perceived importance of price and location, or price and ambiance, are significant. On the other hand, the difference in perceived importance between customer service and price is not significant.

#### Number entry question

```{r,echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1234567)
qualtrics$` Willingness-to-pay (in EUR)`<- abs(as.integer(rnorm(n = 117,mean=23,sd=40)))
qualtrics$` Customer Service` <- abs(as.integer(runif(n=117,min=0,max = 100)))
```


A number entry question is a recommended type of question if you are interested in obtaining ratio data type. We will use this type of question together with a constant sum question type to collect data that can be analyzed with regression analysis.**Note that in this case we treat constant sum data as ratio data and therefore assume that 0 means complete absence.**  

Here is a glimpse in answers on how important is each factor to our respondents when it comes to dinning outside:

```{r, echo= FALSE}
qualtrics[1:6,stringr::str_detect(names(qualtrics), paste0(c(" Location"," Price"," Ambience"," Customer Service"), collapse = "|"))]%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

Additionally, we asked our respondents how much are they willing to spend on dinner on average. In order to handle data easier, we will create a new data frame where we merge all the data together:

```{r}
dinner <- subset(qualtrics, select = stringr::str_detect(names(qualtrics), paste0(c(" Location"," Price"," Ambience"," Customer Service", " Willingness-to-pay"), collapse = "|")))
head(dinner)%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = T)
```

Before we conduct a linear regression analysis, we need to take a look at correlation matrix:  

```{r}
correlation <-cor(dinner, method=c('pearson'))
correlation
```
From our data we see, for instance, that some negative correlation between willingness to pay and importance of ambiance as well as some positive correlation between importance of customer service and willingness-to-pay. Let us observe descriptive statistics as well:  

```{r}
psych::describe(dinner)%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

We see that difference between mean and median does not suggest (at the first sight) great effect of outliers.

Let us now do linear regression analysis:

```{r}
dinner <- as_tibble(dinner)
dinner <- dplyr::rename(dinner, 
              Location = ends_with("Location", ignore.case = FALSE),
                 Price = ends_with("Price", ignore.case = FALSE),
                Ambience = ends_with("Ambience", ignore.case = FALSE)
                )

mlr.dinner <- lm(` Willingness-to-pay (in EUR)` ~ Location + Price + Ambience+` Customer Service`, data = dinner)
summary(mlr.dinner)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
coeff <- summary(mlr.dinner)
```

Out of all factors of importance when dinning out, the only one that suggests significance at 0.05 level of significance is ambience. From the summary we can conclude that increase in importance of ambience by 1 point, leads to decrease in willingness to pay by `r summary(mlr.dinner)$coefficients[4,1]`.

```{r}
confint(mlr.dinner)%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

From confidence intervals, We can conclude that when we do not consider any of given factors (location, price, ambience and customer service), willingness to pay  will be somewhere between `r confint(mlr.dinner)[1,1]`EUR and `r confint(mlr.dinner)[1,2]`EUR. Besides that, for each increase in importance of dinner ambiance by one point, there will be an average decrease of willingness to pay between `r confint(mlr.dinner)[4,1]` and `r confint(mlr.dinner)[4,2]`.

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(ggstatsplot)
ggcoefstats(x = mlr.dinner,
            title = "Willingness to pay predicted by importance of factors")
```


There are couple of things we need to consider when we do multiple linear regression. One of them are potential outliers in our data. Here we identify and visualize them:

```{r}
# Outliers
outlier_values <- boxplot.stats(mlr.dinner$residuals)$out  # outlier values.
outlier_values
```

We identified observations that belong to outlier values. We can even visualize them too:

```{r}
boxplot(mlr.dinner$residuals, main="Willingnes to pay", boxwex=0.1)
```

In addition, we need to observe whether there are any influential observations:

```{r}
plot(mlr.dinner,4)
```

A rule of thumb to determine whether an observation should be classified as influential or not is to look for observation with a Cook’s distance > 1 .We see from the graph that there are no influential observations.


Another thing to consider is linearity, i.e. that the relationship between the dependent and the independent variable can be reasonably approximated in linear terms:

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Linear specification
library(car)
avPlots(mlr.dinner)
```

In our example it does not seem that linear relationships can be reasonably assumed for all variables.

As we already learned, another important assumption of the linear model is that the error terms have a constant variance (i.e., homoscedasticity):
```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Breusch-Pagan Test
library(lmtest)
bptest(mlr.dinner)
```

The null hypothesis for this test is that the error variances are all equal, and our result is insignificant. Therefore, this assumption is met. 

Another assumption to be met is that the error term is normally distributed. One way to check for normal distribution of the data is to employ statistical with the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed. One of these is a Shapiro–Wilk test:

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
shapiro.test(resid(mlr.dinner))
```

When the assumption of normally distributed errors is not met (as it is not met in our case), this might again be due to a misspecification of your model, in which case it might help to transform your data.


Finally, we need to check for multicollinearity, the case when there is a strong linear relationship between the independent variables:

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
correlation <-cor(dinner, method=c('pearson'))
correlation
```

By observing our correlation matrix, we can see that non of the coefficients suggest values close to 0.8 or 0.9. Consequently, we conclude that there are no concerns regarding the multicolinearity between independent variables.

### Reporting

After you are done with statistical analysis, you are ready to create visually appealing and understandable graphs for your final report. In the following sections you can get certain ideas (and R code) for visualization of data obtained by frequently asked types of questions.

::: {.infobox_orange .hint data-latex="{hint}"}

The format (e.g., data frame, matrix, list or similar) in which you have your data stored in R plays important role when you visualize that data. Therefore, reshaping data to the required form will be always a prerequisite for any visualization.  

:::

::: {.infobox_red .caution data-latex="{caution}"}

The focus of the reporting section is on data visualisation, but do not forget to make correct interpretations and add them to your final report. How to communicate results of respective statistical test is a part of chapters before, so consult corresponding chapters if you are not sure how to report results of certain statistical test.

##### Multiple choice question visualisation {-}

In order to visualize a survey data obtained from multiple choice question with single answer, a data format needs to be in the appropriate format. Here we proceed with data format adaptation from the point where we stopped:

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Converting long format to the visualisation-friendly format
mlc_visualisation <- as.data.frame(table(qualtrics$`During a typical day, in what period of the day you prefer watching movies or TV series on Netflix?`))
# Naming columns
names(mlc_visualisation) <- c('Time','Count')
# Observing
library(kableExtra)
mlc_visualisation %>%
kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

R package `ggplot2` allows you to create visually appealing graphs. Below you can see how to create simple versions of a bar chart and a pie chart.

```{r, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Multiple choice question with single answer - a bar chart
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data=mlc_visualisation,aes(x=Time, y=Count, fill=Time)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') + 
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0("n=",round(Count))), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = NULL, title = "The period of the day you prefer watching movies?") +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "#666666"))
p
```

```{r}
# Multiple choice question with single answer - a pie chart
p<-ggplot(mlc_visualisation, aes(x="", y=Count, fill=Time))+
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") + 
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0("n=",round(Count))), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = NULL, title = "The period of the day you prefer watching movies?") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "#666666"))
p
```

#### Multiple choice question with multiple answers

If our multiple choice question has more possible answers, we would need first to calculate share of cases when each possible answer was selected.

```{r}
#setDT(df.cochran, keep.rownames = TRUE)
#colnames(df.cochran)[1]<-"Brand"
#df.cochran %>%
#kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
#  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```
After we make sure we have our data in the required form, we can create a nice bar chart:

```{r}
# Multiple choice question with multiple answers - a bar chart
library(ggplot2)
#p <- ggplot(data=df.cochran,aes(x=Brand, y=Share_of_cases, fill=Brand)) +
#  geom_bar(stat='identity') + 
#  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(Share_of_cases),"%")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+
#  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +
#  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = NULL, title = "Brands repsondents are familiar with") +
#  theme_minimal() + 
#  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
#        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
#        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "#666666"))
#p
```

##### Rank order question

In case of ranked data, one need to transform data from wide format to long format first.

```{r}
# Packages
library(reshape2)
library(ggpubr)
library(rstatix)
library(ggstatsplot)
# Data in wide format
head(rank.data)%>%
kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
# Data in long format
head(rank.data.long)%>%
kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```
Simple way to depict ranks is a chart of box plots:

```{r}
# Rank order question - box plots
p <- ggplot(rank.data.long, aes(x=Feature, y=Rank, fill= Feature)) +
    geom_boxplot()  +
    theme_minimal() +
    ggtitle(label="Perceived importance of features")+
    theme(axis.text = element_blank())
p
```

Package `ggstatsplot()` provides a great feature, which enables creation of a plot and conducting a statistical test at the same time. 


```{r}
# Rank order question - ggstatsplot
ggstatsplot::ggwithinstats(
  data = rank.data.long,
  x = Feature,
  y = Rank,
  type = "np",
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, # show pairwise comparison test results
  title = "What features are important to you when evualting fitness trackers?")
```


#### Constant Sum question

Required data format for a data obtained from constant sum question is similar to ranked data.

```{r}
# Data in long format
head(constant.sum.long) %>%
kableExtra::kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

Here is one way to visualize data obtained from constant sum question.

```{r,error=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Constant sum question
p<-constant.sum.long %>% 
  filter(Factor!="id") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Factor, y=Points, fill= Factor)) +
    geom_boxplot()  +
    theme_minimal() +
    ggtitle("What factors do you consider when choosing a place to go for a dinner?") 
p
```

```{r}
ggstatsplot::ggwithinstats(
  data = constant.sum.long %>% filter(Factor!="id"), # excluding "id" column from the data
  x = Factor,
  y = Points,
  type = "p",
  bf.message = F,
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, # show pairwise comparison test results
  title = "What factors do you consider when choosing a place to go for a dinner?")
```

## Frequently asked questions

Here we will post the most frequent issues you might face with handling Qualtrics data in R.

### Multiple answers stored in one cell in CSV


*Issue:* When exported from Qualtrics to CSV, answers on multiple choice questions with multiple answers are stored in one cell. In the picture below you can see that this issue appears in the column "Q2", where a respondent chose two answers ("1" and "2"), and these two answers are merged together in one cell.

```{r,echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/combined.png')
```

*Solution:*
  
  First, when you go to export your data from Qualtrics ("Data & Analysis" > "Export & Import" > "Export data") choose CSV, and in the bottom-right corner you will find "More options". After you click it, scroll down a bit, and there you should tick "Split multi-value fields into columns". Please make sure that you are using the correct settings in Qualtrics export as depicted below:
  
```{r,echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qualtrics_export.png')
```

So, make sure you tick:
  
  * Use numeric values
* Remove line breaks
* Split multi-value fields into columns

This should result in your multi-value fields being divided into columns as depicted below.

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/separate.png')
```

### Labels for numeric values in CSV output 

**Issue**: When exported from Qualtrics to CSV, answers are coded as numeric values, and I don't know which value corresponds to which label(=answer)?

**Solution:**

You can check it or even change it in Qualtrics by doing the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Survey tab and select the question you want to check labels for.

```{r,  echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/recode1.png')
```

2. Click the gray gear to the left to access the Question Options and choose Recode Values.

```{r,  echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width='72%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/recode2.png')
```

There you can see how Qualtrics coded your responses and you can potentially change it.

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/recode3.png')
```


### Bar chart for multiple choice question with multiple answers

**Issue:** How to create a bar chart for multiple answers on multiple choice questions?

**Solution:**

Let's load the packages `qualtRics` and `ggplot2` and Qualtrics survey data first:
  
```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(qualtRics)
library(ggplot2)
qualtrics_1 <- read_survey("data/mrda_2.csv")
```

We would like to visualize question 2 (multiple choice question with multiple answers) which has 4 categories:
  
```{r}
qualtrics_1[,c("Q2_1","Q2_2","Q2_3","Q2_4")]
```

We see that we have some NA values that needs to be handeled. Therefore, we replace NA values with 0 for each category:
  
```{r}
qualtrics_1$Q2_1 <- ifelse(is.na(qualtrics_1$Q2_1),0,qualtrics_1$Q2_1)
qualtrics_1$Q2_2 <- ifelse(is.na(qualtrics_1$Q2_2),0,qualtrics_1$Q2_2)
qualtrics_1$Q2_3 <- ifelse(is.na(qualtrics_1$Q2_3),0,qualtrics_1$Q2_3)
qualtrics_1$Q2_4 <- ifelse(is.na(qualtrics_1$Q2_4),0,qualtrics_1$Q2_4)
```

Third, we compute share for each category:
  
```{r}
share_1 <- sum(qualtrics_1$Q2_1)/nrow(qualtrics_1)
share_2 <- sum(qualtrics_1$Q2_2)/nrow(qualtrics_1)
share_3 <- sum(qualtrics_1$Q2_3)/nrow(qualtrics_1)
share_4 <- sum(qualtrics_1$Q2_4)/nrow(qualtrics_1)
```

Finally, we add category shares to the rest of the data:
  
```{r}
shares <- data.frame(share = rbind(share_1,share_2,share_3,share_4),response=c("yes, at uni", "yes, at job", "yes, other", "no"))
head(shares)
```

::: {.infobox_red .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
If you are not sure which numeric value refers to which label, you can find how to do it under question **"Labels for numeric values in CSV output"**.
:::
  
Now we are set to produce a bar chart. Please note two important points:
  
* We use `reorder()` function to wrap around the variable on x-axis in aesthetics part of ggplot function. In this way our bar chart will be shown in descending order.
* We use `coord_flip()` function to turn our bar chart from being vertical to horizontal position. 

```{r}
ggplot(shares, aes(x =reorder(response,share), y = share)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = response)) + 
  labs(x = "", y = "", title = "Share of responses") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.0f%%", share/sum(share) * 100)), hjust = -0.2, size=6) + 
  theme_minimal() + ylim(0,0.8) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=16), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=16), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "#666666"), 
        legend.position = "none", title = element_text(size=20)) + 
  coord_flip()
```

In the end, to save generated plot, we can use `ggsave()` function. The plot will be saved in your working directory.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
ggsave("bar_chart.jpg", height = 5, width = 8.5)  
```

### How to create a radar plot?

**Issue:** How can I create a radar plot and compare numeric values across different categories or groups?
  
**Solution:**
  
```{r, include=FALSE}
Radar_chart <- readRDS("data/radar_plot_df.RDS")
```

To explain this issue, we will use a data frame with two categories and several numeric variables. 

```{r}
head(Radar_chart)
```

In this data frame we merged two information from a survey:
  
* Ranking(R) - how participants evaluated the city of Vienna on the dimensions of stability, education, health care, and culture (the scores for each dimension are derived from multi-item scales consisting of 7-point Likert-scales).
* Importance(I) - how important participants judge each of the dimensions to be on a 7-point Likert-scale.

We wish to create a radar plot to directly compare ranking and importance of each variable.

First, we create to separate data frames; one for "Ranking" 

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggiraph)
library(ggiraphExtra)

# Creation of Ranking table
Ranking <- Radar_chart[,1:4]
# Assigning the corresponding row name
Ranking$group <- "Ranking"

head(Ranking)
```

...and one for "Importance"

```{r}
# Creation of Importance table
Importance <- Radar_chart[,5:8]
# Assigning the corresponding row name
Importance$group <- "Importance"
head(Importance)
```

Now we want to bind these two data frames (Ranking and Importance), but beforehand we need to make sure that they have the same names of columns.

```{r}
colnames(Ranking) <- c("Stability","Education","Healthcare","Culture","group")  
colnames(Importance) <- c("Stability","Education","Healthcare","Culture","group")
```

Our data frames are now prepared to be combined in one:
  
```{r}
# Connecting two data frames by rows
Radar_chart_new <- rbind(Ranking,Importance)
```

Now we can run `ggRadar()` to create a radar plot as follows:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Radar chart"}
# Radar plot
ggRadar(data=Radar_chart_new,
        aes(color=group), # Each category in the column "Name" will be assigned to different color
        interactive = FALSE, # When hover over the graph values appear
        rescale = FALSE, # If TRUE, all continuous variables in the data.frame are rescaled.
        ylim = 2, # y coordinates ranges.
        alpha = 0.35) # Transparency of colors in the graph
```

### Vertical Likert line chart

Additionally, we can calculate mean values and compare them with `ggPair()`:
  
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
Ranking_mean <- apply(Radar_chart_new[Radar_chart_new$group=="Ranking",1:4],2,mean)
Ranking_mean <- data.frame(mean =t(Ranking_mean),group="Ranking")
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
Importance_mean <- apply(Radar_chart_new[Radar_chart_new$group=="Importance",1:4],2,mean)
Importance_mean <- data.frame(mean = t(Importance_mean),group="Importance")
```

Before plotting we need to bind two data frames by rows:
  
```{r}
Pair_chart <- rbind(Ranking_mean,Importance_mean)
Pair_chart$group <- as.factor(Pair_chart$group)
```

Finally, we can create a pair plot using the `ggPair()` function as follows:
  
```{r, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Pair chart"}
library(ggiraph)
library(ggiraphExtra)
# Pair plot
ggPair(Pair_chart,
       horizontal=TRUE,
       interactive=FALSE,
       aes(color=group))
```

### Diverging stacked barchart

```{r, include=FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
Radar_chart <- readRDS("data/radar_plot_df.RDS")
likert_chart <- Radar_chart[5:8]
```

Let's use an example data frame again, where we observe the scores on 4 variables on a 7-point Likert-scale.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
head(likert_chart)
```

Now we can use the `likert()` function from the `HH` package to create the Diverging stacked barchart as follows:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(HH)
likert(t(likert_chart)[,7:1], horizontal = TRUE,
       main = "Diverging stacked barcharts", 
       xlab = "Percent", 
       auto.key = list(space = "right", columns = 1,
                     reverse = TRUE))
```

### Collapse/recode categories

**Issue:** If you have certain number of categories (e.g. countries) and you would like to aggregate them by specific criteria (e.g. continents), how can you do it?

**Solution:** 

There are several ways to do it, but we will show you the most intuitive.

For this purpose we will create a data frame:

```{r}
#generate random data
df <- data.frame(country_id = round(runif(n = 100, min = 1, max = 7),0))
#code factor variable for country
df$country <- factor(df$country_id, levels = 1:7, labels = c("Bangladesh","Japan", "Austria", "Germany","Italy", "USA", "Taiwan"))
str(df)
```

In our data frame we have two columns, "country_id" and "country". 

Now we will create a third column, "region", and assign each country to corresponding continent. For that purpose, we use `recode` function to assign region by country and create new variable for region:
 
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(car)
df$region = car::recode(df$country, "'Bangladesh'='Asia'; 'Japan'='Asia'; 'Austria'='Europe'; 'Germany'='Europe'; 'Italy'='Europe'; 'Taiwan'='Asia'; 'USA'='other'")
head(df)
```

This also works with numeric values:

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
df$region_1 = as.factor(recode(df$country_id, "1='Asia'; 2='Asia'; 3='Europe'; 3='Europe'; 4='Europe'; 5='Asia'; 6='other'; 7 = 'Asia'"))
head(df)
```

Alternatively, you can use `gsub()` function to replace each category individually:

```{r}
df$region_2 = gsub("Bangladesh","Asia",df$country)
df$region_2 = gsub("Japan","Asia",df$region_2)
df$region_2 = gsub("Austria","Europe",df$region_2)
df$region_2 = gsub("Germany","Europe",df$region_2)
df$region_2 = gsub("Italy","Europe",df$region_2)
df$region_2 = gsub("Taiwan","Asia",df$region_2)
df$region_2 = gsub("USA","other",df$region_2)
df$region_2 <- as.factor(df$region_2)
head(df)
```
